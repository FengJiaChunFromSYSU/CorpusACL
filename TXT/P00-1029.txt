Abstract
An approach to automatic detection
of syllable structure is presented. We
demonstrate a novel application of
EM-based clustering to multivariate
data, exempli ed by the induction
of 3- and 5-dimensional probabilistic syllable classes. The qualitative
evaluation shows that the method
yields phonologically meaningful syllable classes. We then propose a
novel approach to grapheme-to-phoneme conversion and show that syllable structure represents valuable
information for pronunciation systems.
1 Introduction
In this paper we present an approach to unsupervised learning and automatic detection
of syllable structure. The primary goal of
the paper is to demonstrate the application
of EM-based clustering to multivariate data.
The suitability of this approach is exempli ed
by the induction of 3- and 5-dimensional probabilistic syllable classes. A secondary goal is
to outline a novel approach to the conversion
of graphemes to phonemes (g2p) which uses a
context-free grammar (cfg) to generate all sequences of phonemes corresponding to a given
orthographic input word and then ranks the
hypotheses according to the probabilistic information coded in the syllable classes.
Our approach builds on two resources. The
rst resource is a cfg for g2p conversion that
was constructed manually by a linguistic expert (M ller, 2000). The grammar describes
how words are composed of syllables and how
syllables consist of parts that are conventionally called onset, nucleus and coda, which in
turn are composed of phonemes, and corresponding graphemes. The second resource
consists of a multivariate clustering algorithm
that is used to reveal syllable structure hidden in unannotated training data. In a rst
step, we collect syllables by going through a
large text corpus, looking up the words and
their syllabi cations in a pronunciation dictionary and counting the occurrence frequencies
of the syllable types. Probabilistic syllable
classes are then computed by applying maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete
data via the EM algorithm. Two-dimensional
EM-based clustering has been applied to tasks
in syntax (Rooth et al., 1999), but so far this
approach has not been used to derive models
of higher dimensionality and, to the best of
our knowledge, this is the rst time that it
is being applied to speech. Accordingly, we
have trained 3- and 5-dimensional models for
English and German syllable structure.
The obtained models of syllable structure were evaluated in three ways. Firstly,
the 3-dimensional models were subjected to
a pseudo-disambiguation task, the result of
which shows that the onset is the most variable part of the syllable. Secondly, the resulting syllable classes were qualitatively evaluated from a phonological and phonotactic
point of view. Thirdly, a 5-dimensional syllable model for German was tested in a g2p
conversion task. The results compare well
with the best currently available data-driven
approaches to g2p conversion (e.g., (Damper
et al., 1999)) and suggest that syllable strucclass 0 0.212

components in text-to-speech (TTS) conversion systems, and they are also increasingly
used to generate pronunciation variants in automatic speech recognition.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the multivariate clustering algorithm. In Section 3 we
present four experiments based on 3- and 5dimensional data for German and English.
Section 4 is dedicated to evaluation and in
Section 5 we discuss our results.
2 Multivariate Syllable Clustering
EM-based clustering has been derived and applied to syntax (Rooth et al., 1999). Unfortunately, this approach is not applicable to
multivariate data with more than two dimensions. However, we consider syllables to consist of at least three dimensions corresponding to parts of the internal syllable structure:
onset, nucleus and coda. We have also experimented with 5-dimensional models by adding
two more dimensions: position of the syllable in the word and stress status. In our
multivariate clustering approach, classes corresponding to syllables are viewed as hidden
data in the context of maximum likelihood estimation from incomplete data via the EM algorithm. The two main tasks of EM-based
clustering are (i) the induction of a smooth
probability model on the data, and (ii) the
automatic discovery of class structure in the
data. Both aspects are considered in our application. We aim to derive a probability
distribution p(y) on syllables y from a large
sample. The key idea is to view y as conditioned on an unobserved class c 2 C, where
the classes are given no prior interpretation.
The probability of a syllable y = (y1 :: yd) 2
Y1 :: Yd d 3 is de ned as:
p(y) =
X
c2C
p(c y) =
X
c2C
p(c)p(yjc)
=
X
c2C
p(c)
d
Y
i=1
p(yijc)
Note that conditioning of yi on each other is
solely made through the classes c via the independence assumption p(yjc) =
Qd
i=1 p(yijc).
This assumption makes clustering feasible in
the rst place later on (in Section 4.1) we
will experimentally determine the number jCj
of classes such that the assumption is optimally met. The EM algorithm (Dempster et
al., 1977) is directed at maximizing the incomplete data log-likelihood L =
Py
~
p(y) ln p(y)
as a function of the probability distribution
p for a given empirical probability distribution ~
p. Our application is an instance of the
EM-algorithm for context-free models (Baum
et al., 1970), from which simple re-estimation
formulae can be derived. Let f (y) the frequency of syllable y, and jf j =
Py2Y f (y)
the total frequency of the sample (i.e. ~
p(y) =

As shown by Baum et al. (1970), every such

function L, and a sequence of re-estimates
eventually converges to a (local) maximum.
3 Experiments
A sample of syllables serves as input to the
multivariate clustering algorithm. The German data were extracted from the Stuttgarter
Zeitung (STZ), a newspaper corpus of about
31 million words. The English data came from
the British National Corpus (BNC), a collection of written and spoken language containing about 100 million words. For both
languages, syllables were collected by going
through the corpus, looking up the words and
their syllabi cations in a pronunciation dictionary (Baayen et al., 1993)1 and counting the
occurrence frequencies of the syllable types2.
1We slightly modi ed the English pronunciation
lexicon to obtain non-empty nuclei, e.g. /idealism/ aI] dI@] lIzm,] was modi ed to aI] dI@] lI] z@m]
(SAMPA transcription).
2Subsequent experiments on syllable types (M ller
et al., 2000) have shown that frequency counts represent valuable information for our clustering task.
In two experiments, we induced 3-dimensional
models based on syllable onset, nucleus, and
coda. We collected 9327 distinct German syllables and 13,598 distinct English syllables.
The number of syllable classes was systematically varied in iterated training runs and
ranged from 1 to 200.
Figure 1 shows a selected segment of class
#0 from a 3-dimensional English model with
12 classes. The rst column displays the class
index 0 and the class probability p(0). The
most probable onsets and their probabilities
are listed in descending order in the second
column, as are nucleus and coda in the third
and fourth columns, respectively. Empty onsets and codas were labeled NOP nucleus] .
Class #0 contains the highly frequent function words in, is, it, its as well as the su xes
-ing ,-ting, -ling. Notice that these function
words and su xes appear to be separated in
the 5-dimensional model (classes #1 and #3
in Figure 3).
In two further experiments, we induced 5dimensional models, augmented by the additional parameters of position of the syllable in
the word and stress status. Syllable position
has four values: monosyllabic (ONE), initial
(INI), medial (MED), and nal (FIN). Stress

Figure 4: Evaluation on pseudo-disambiguation task for English (left) and German (right)
has two values: stressed (STR) and unstressed
(USTR). We collected 16,595 distinct German
syllables and 24,365 distinct English syllables.
The number of syllable classes ranged from 1
to 200. Figure 2 illustrates (part of) class #46
from a 5-dimensional German model with 50
classes. Syllable position and stress are displayed in the last two columns.
4 Evaluation
In the following sections, (i) the 3-dimensional models are subjected to a pseudodisambiguation task (4.1) (ii) the syllable
classes are qualitatively evaluated (4.2) and
(iii) the 5-dimensional syllable model for German is tested in a g2p task (4.3).
4.1 Pseudo-Disambiguation
We evaluated our 3-dimensional clustering models on a pseudo-disambiguation
task similar to the one described by
Rooth et al. (1999), but speci ed to onset,
nucleus, and coda ambiguity. The rst task
is to judge which of two onsets on and on
0
is more likely to appear in the context of a
given nucleus n and a given coda cod. For this
purpose, we constructed an evaluation corpus of 3000 syllables (on n cod) selected from
the original data. Then, randomly chosen onsets on
0 were attached to all syllables in the
evaluation corpus, with the resulting syllables
(on
0 n cod) appearing neither in the training
nor in the evaluation corpus. Furthermore,
the elements on n cod, and on
0 were required
to be part of the training corpus.
Clustering models were parameterized in
(up to 10) starting values of EM-training, in
the number of classes of the model (up to
200), resulting in a sequence of 10 20 models. Accuracy was calculated as the number
of times the model decided p(on n cod)
p(on
0 n cod) for all choices made. Two similar tasks were designed for nucleus and coda.
Results for the best starting values are
shown in Figure 4. Models of 12 classes
show the highest accuracy rates. For German
we reached accuracy rates of 88-90% (nucleus
and coda) and 77% (onset). For English we
achieved accuracy rates of 92% (coda), 84%
(nucleus), and 76% (onset). The results of
the pseudo-disambiguation agree with intuition: in both languages (i) the onset is the
most variable part of the syllable, as it is easy
to nd minimal pairs that vary in the onset,
(ii) it is easier to predict the coda and nucleus,
as their choice is more restricted.
4.2 Qualitative Evaluation
The following discussion is restricted to the 5dimensional syllable models, as the quality of
the output increased when more dimensions
were added. We can look at the results from
di erent angles. For instance, we can verify
if any of the classes are mainly representatives of a syllable class pertinent to a particular nucleus (as it is the case with the 3dimensional models). Another interesting aspect is whether there are syllable classes that
represent parts of lexical content words, as opposed to high-frequency function words. Finally, some syllable classes may correspond to
productive a xes.

Figure 5: Classes #4, #7, #26, #34, #40 of the 5-dimensional German model
German. The majority of syllable classes
obtained for German is dominated by one particular nucleus per syllable class. In 24 out of
50 classes the probability of the dominant nucleus is greater than 99%, and in 9 cases it is
indeed 100%. The only syllable nuclei that do
not dominate any class are the front rounded
vowels /y:, Y, 2:, 9/, the front vowel /E:/ and
the diphthong /OY/, all of which are among
the least frequently occurring nuclei in the lexicon of German. Figure 5 depicts the classes
that will be discussed now.
Almost one third (28%) of the 50 classes
are representatives of high-frequency function
words. For example, class #7 is dominated by
the function words in, ich, ist, im, sind, sich,
all of which contain the short vowel /I/.
Another 32% of the 50 classes represents
syllables that are most likely to occur in initial, medial and nal positions in the open
word classes of the lexicon, i.e. nouns, adjectives, and verbs. Class #4 covers several
lexical entries involving the diphthong /aI/
mostly in stressed word-initial syllables. Class
#40 provides complimentary information, as
it also includes syllables containing /aI/, but
here mostly in word-medial position.
We also observe syllable classes that represent productive pre xes (e.g., ver-, er-, zer-,
vor-, her- in class #26) and su xes (e.g.,
-lich, -ig in class #34). Finally, there are
two syllable classes (not displayed) that cover
the most common in ectional su xes involving the vowel /@/ (schwa).
Class numbers are informative insofar as
the classes are ranked by decreasing probability. Lower-ranked classes tend (i) not to
be dominated by one nucleus (ii) to contain
vowels with relatively low frequency of occurrence and (iii) to yield less clear patterns in
terms of word class or stress or position. For
illustration, class #46 (Figure 2) represents
the syllable ent Ent], both as a pre x (INI)
and as a su x (FIN), the former being unstressed (as in Entwurf design ) and the latter stressed (as in Dirigent conductor ).
English. In 24 out of the 50 syllable classes
obtained for English one dominant nucleus per
syllable class is observed. In all of these cases
the probability of the nucleus is larger than
99% and in 7 classes the nucleus probability is
100%. Besides several diphthongs only the relatively infrequent vowels /V/, /A:/ and /3:/
do not dominate any class. Figure 3 shows
the classes that are described as follows.
High-frequency function words are represented by 10 syllable classes. For example,
class #0 and #17 and are dominated by the
determiners the and a, respectively, and class
#1 contains function words that involve the
short vowel /I/, such as in, is, it, his, if, its.
Productive word-forming su xes are found
in class #3 (-ing), and common in ectional
su xes in class #4 (-er, -es, -ed). Class #10

is particularly interesting in that it represents
a comparably large number of common sufxes, such as -tion, -ment, -al, -ant, -ent, ence and others.
The majority of syllable classes, viz. 31 out
of 50, contains syllables that are likely to be
found in initial, medial and nal positions in
the open word classes of the lexicon. For example, class #14 represents mostly stressed
syllables involving the vowels /eI, A:, e:, O:/
and others, in a variety of syllable positions in
nouns, adjectives or verbs.
4.3 Evaluation by g2p Conversion
In this section, we present a novel method
of g2p conversion (i) using a cfg to produce
all possible phonemic correspondences of a
given grapheme string, (ii) applying a probabilistic syllable model to rank the pronunciation hypotheses, and (iii) predicting pronunciation by choosing the most probable analysis. We used a cfg for generating transcriptions, because grammars are expressive and
writing grammar-rules is easy and intuitive.
Our grammar describes how words are composed of syllables and syllables branch into
onset, nucleus and coda. These syllable parts
are re-written by the grammar as sequences
of natural phone classes, e.g. stops, fricatives, nasals, liquids, as well as long and
short vowels, and diphthongs. The phone
classes are then re-interpreted as the individual phonemes that they are made up of. Finally, for each phoneme all possible graphemic
correspondences are listed.
Figure 6 illustrates two analyses (out of
100) of the German word L tzinn (tin solder). The phoneme strings (represented by
non-terminals named phon=... ) and the
syllable boundaries (represented by the nonterminal Syl ) can be extracted from these
analyses. Figure 6 depicts both an incorrect analysis l2:ts] i:n] and its correct counterpart l2:t] tsIn]. The next step is to rank
these transcriptions by assigning probabilities
to them. The key idea is to take the product of the syllable probabilities. Using the 5dimensional3 German syllable model yields a
probability of 7:5 10;7
3:1 10;7
= 2:3 10;13
for the incorrect analysis and a probability of
1:5 10;7
6:5 10;6
= 9:8 10;13
for the correct
one. Thus we achieve the desired result of assigning the higher probability to the correct
transcription.
We evaluated our g2p system on a test set
of 1835 unseen words. The ambiguity expressed as the average number of analyses per
word was 289. The test set was constructed
by collecting 295,102 words from the German
Celex dictionary (Baayen et al., 1993) that
were not seen in the STZ corpus. From this
set we manually eliminated (i) foreign words,
(ii) acronyms, (iii) proper names, (iv) verbs,
and (v) words with more than three syllables.
The resulting test set is available on the World
Wide Web4.
Figure 7 shows the performance of four g2p
systems. The second and fourth columns show
the accuracy of two baseline systems: g2p conversion using the 3- and 5-dimensional empirical distributions (Section 2), respectively.

and a gain of 8% over the performance of the

5 Discussion
We have presented an approach to unsupervised learning and automatic detection of syllable structure, using EM-based multivariate
clustering. The method yields phonologically
meaningful syllable classes. These classes are
shown to represent valuable input information
in a g2p conversion task.
In contrast to the application of twodimensional EM-based clustering to syntax
(Rooth et al., 1999), where semantic relations were revealed between verbs and objects,
the syllable models cannot a priori be expected to yield similarly meaningful properties. This is because the syllable constituents
(or phones) represent an inventory with a
small number of units which can be combined
to form meaningful larger units, viz. morphemes and words, but which do not themselves carry meaning. Thus, there is no reason
why certain syllable types should occur significantly more often than others, except for the
fact that certain morphemes and words have a
higher frequency count than others in a given
text corpus. As discussed in Section 4.2, however, we do nd some interesting properties
of syllable classes, some of which apparently
represent high-frequency function words and
productive a xes, while others are typically
found in lexical content words. Subjected to
545 resp. 95 words could not be disambiguated
by the 3- resp. 5-dimensional empirical distributions.
The reported relatively small gains can be explained
by the fact that our syllable models were applied only
to this small number of ambiguous words.
a pseudo-disambiguation task (Section 4.1),
the 3-dimensional models con rm the intuition that the onset is the most variable part
of the syllable.
In a feasibility study we applied the 5dimensional syllable model obtained for German to a g2p conversion task. Automatic
conversion of a string of characters, i.e. a
word, into a string of phonemes, i.e. its pronunciation, is essential for applications such
as speech synthesis from unrestricted text input, which can be expected to contain words
that are not in the system's pronunciation
dictionary or otherwise unknown to the system. The main purpose of the feasibility
study was to demonstrate the relevance of the
phonological information on syllable structure
for g2p conversion. Therefore, information
and probabilities derived from an alignment
of grapheme and phoneme strings, i.e. the
lowest two levels in the trees displayed in Figure 6, was deliberately ignored. Data-driven
pronunciation systems usually rely on training
data that include an alignment of graphemes
and phonemes. Damper et al. (1999) have
shown that the use of unaligned training data
signi cantly reduces the performance of g2p
systems. In our experiment, with training
on unannotated text corpora and without an
alignment of graphemes and phonemes, we obtained a word accuracy rate of 75.3% for the
5-dimensional German syllable model.
Comparison of this performance with other
systems is di cult: (i) hardly any quantitative g2p performance data are available for
German (ii) comparisons across languages are
hard to interpret (iii) comparisons across different approaches require cautious interpretations. The most direct point of comparison
is the method presented by M ller (2000). In
one of her experiments, the standard probability model was applied to the hand-crafted
cfg presented in this paper, yielding 42% word
accuracy as evaluated on our test set. Running the test set through the pronunciation
rule system of the IMS German Festival TTS
system (M hler, 1999) resulted in 55% word
accuracy. The Bell Labs German TTS system (M bius, 1999) performed at better than
94% word accuracy on our test set. This TTS
system relies on an annotation of morphological structure for the words in its lexicon
and it performs a morphological analysis of
unknown words (M bius, 1998) the pronunciation rules draw on this structural information. These comparative results emphasize
the value of phonotactic knowledge and information on syllable structure and morphological structure for g2p conversion.
In a comparison across languages, a word
accuracy rate of 75.3% for our 5-dimensional
German syllable model is slightly higher than
the best data-driven method for English with
72% (Damper et al., 1999). Recently, Bouma
(2000) has reported a word accuracy of 92.6%
for Dutch, using a `lazy' training strategy on
data aligned with the correct phoneme string,
and a hand-crafted system that relied on a
large set of rule templates and a many-to-one
mapping of characters to graphemes preceding
the actual g2p conversion.
We are con dent that a judicious combination of phonological information of the type
employed in our feasibility study with standard techniques such as g2p alignment of
training data will produce a pronunciation
system with a word accuracy that matches
the one reported by Bouma (2000). We believe, however, that for an optimally performing system as is desired for TTS, an even
more complex design will have to be adopted.
In many languages, including English, German and Dutch, access to morphological and
phonological information is required to reliably predict the pronunciation of words this
view is further evidenced by the performance
of the Bell Labs system, which relies on precisely this type of information. We agree with
Sproat (1998, p. 77) that it is unrealistic to expect optimal results from a system that has no
access to this type of information or is trained
on data that are insu cient for the task.
