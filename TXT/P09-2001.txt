Abstract
Variational EM has become a popular
technique in probabilistic NLP with hidden variables. Commonly, for computational tractability, we make strong independence assumptions, such as the meanfield assumption, in approximating posterior distributions over hidden variables.
We show how a looser restriction on the
approximate posterior, requiring it to be a
mixture, can help inject prior knowledge
to exploit soft constraints during the variational E-step.
1 Introduction
Learning natural language in an unsupervised way
commonly involves the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm to optimize the parameters of a
generative model, often a probabilistic grammar
(Pereira and Schabes, 1992). Later approaches include variational EM in a Bayesian setting (Beal
and Gharamani, 2003), which has been shown to
obtain even better results for various natural language tasks over EM (e.g., Cohen et al., 2008).
Variational EM usually makes the mean-field
assumption, factoring the posterior over hidden
variables into independent distributions. Bishop et
al. (1998) showed how to use a less strict assumption: a mixture of factorized distributions.
In other work, soft or hard constraints on the
posterior during the E-step have been explored
in order to improve performance. For example,
Smith and Eisner (2006) have penalized the approximate posterior over dependency structures
in a natural language grammar induction task to
avoid long range dependencies between words.
Grac
�a et al. (2007) added linear constraints on expected values of features of the hidden variables in
an alignment task.
In this paper, we use posterior mixtures to inject
bias or prior knowledge into a Bayesian model.
We show that empirically, injecting prior knowledge improves performance on an unsupervised
Chinese grammar induction task.
2 Variational Mixtures with Constraints
Our EM variant encodes prior knowledge in an approximate posterior by constraining it to be from
a mixture family of distributions. We will use x to
denote observable random variables, y to denote
hidden structure, and  to denote the to-be-learned
parameters of the model (coming from a subset of
R for some ).  will denote the parameters of
a prior over . The mean-field assumption in the
Bayesian setting assumes that the posterior has a
factored form:
q(, y) = q()q(y) (1)
Traditionally, variational inference with the meanfield assumption alternates between an E-step
which optimizes q(y) and then an M-step which
optimizes q().1 The mean-field assumption
makes inference feasible, at the expense of optimizing a looser lower bound on the likelihood
(Bishop, 2006). The lower bound that the algorithm optimizes is the following:
F(q(, y), ) = Eq(,y)[log p(x, y,  | )]+H(q)
(2)
where H(q) denotes the entropy of distribution q.
We focus on changing the E-step and as a result,
changing the underlying bound, F(q(, y), ).
Similarly to Bishop et al. (1998), instead of making the strict mean-field assumption, we assume
that the variational model is a mixture. One component of the mixture might take the traditional
form, but others will be used to encourage certain

This optimization can be nested inside another EM algorithm that optimizes ; this is our approach. q() is traditionally conjugate to the likelihood for computational reasons, but our method is not limited to that kind of prior, as
seen in the experiments.

tendencies considered a priori to be appropriate.
Denoting the probability simplex of dimension r
r = { 1, ..., r  Rr : i  0, r
i=1 i =
1}, we require that:
q(, y | ) = r
i=1 iqi(y)qi() (3)
for   r. Qi will denote the family of distributions for the ith mixture component, and Q( r)
will denote the family implied by the mixture of
Q1, . . . , Qr where the mixture coefficients  
r.  comprise r additional variational parameters, in addition to parameters for each qi(y) and
qi().
When one of the mixture components qi is sufficiently expressive,  will tend toward a degenerate solution. In order to force all mixture components to play a role--even at the expense of the
tightness of the variational bound--we will impose hard constraints on :   ~ r  r. In
our experiments (�3), ~ r will be mostly a line segment corresponding to two mixture coefficients.
The role of the variational EM algorithm is to
optimize the variational bound in Eq. 2 with respect to q(y), q(), and . Keeping this intention
in mind, we can replace the E-step and M-step in
the original variational EM algorithm with 2r + 1
coordinate ascent steps, for 1  i  r:
E-step: For each i  {1, ..., r}, optimize the
bound given  and qi (y)|i {1,...,r}\{i} and
qi ()|i {1,...,r} by selecting a new distribution
qi(y).
M-step: For each i  {1, ..., r}, optimize the
bound given  and qi ()|i {1,...,r}\{i} and
qi (y)|i {1,...,r} by selecting a new distribution
qi().
C-step: Optimize the bound by selecting a new set
of coefficients   ~ r in order to optimize the
bound with respect to the mixture coefficients.
We call the revised algorithm constrained mixture variational EM.
For a distribution r(h), we denote by KL(Qi r)
the following:
KL(Qi r) = min
qQi
KL(q(h) r)) (4)
where KL(� �) denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
The next proposition, which is based on a result
in Grac
�a et al. (2007), gives an intuition of how
modifying the variational EM algorithm with Q =
Q( ~ r) affects the solution:
Proposition 1. Constrained mixture variational
EM finds local maxima for a function G(q, )
such that
log p(x | )- min
 ~ r
L(, )  G(q, )  log p(x | )
(5)
where L(, ) =
r
i=1
iKL(Qi p(, y | x, )).
We can understand mixture variational EM as
penalizing the likelihood with a term bounded by
a linear function of the , minimized over ~ r. We
will exploit that bound in �2.2 for computational
tractability.
2.1 Simplex Annealing
The variational EM algorithm still identifies only
local maxima. Different proposals have been for
pushing EM toward a global maximum. In many
cases, these methods are based on choosing different initializations for the EM algorithm (e.g.,
repeated random initializations or a single carefully designed initializer) such that it eventually
gets closer to a global maximum.
We follow the idea of annealing proposed in
Rose et al. (1990) and Smith and Eisner (2006) for
the  by gradually loosening hard constraints on 
as the variational EM algorithm proceeds. We define a sequence of ~ r(t) for t = 0, 1, ... such that
~ r(t)  ~ r(t + 1). First, we have the inequality:
KL(Q( ~ r(t)) p(, y | x, ) (6)
 KL(Q( ~ r(t + 1)) p(, y | x, ))
We say that the annealing schedule is -separated
if we have for any :
KL(Q( ~ r(t)) p(, y | x, )) (7)
 KL(Q( ~ r(t + 1)) p(, y | x, )) 
2(t+1)
-separation requires consecutive families
Q( ~ r(t)) and Q( ~ r(t + 1)) to be similar.
Proposition 1 stated the bound we optimize,
which penalizes the likelihood by subtracting a
positive KL divergence from it. With the separation condition we can show that even though
we penalize likelihood, the variational EM algorithm will still increase likelihood by a certain
amount. Full details are omitted for space and can
be found in ?).

2.2 Tractability
We now turn to further alterations of the bound in
Eq. 2 to make it more tractable. The main problem
is the entropy term which is not easy to compute,
because it includes a log term over a mixture of
distributions from Qi. We require the distributions
in Qi to factorize over the hidden structure y, but
this only helps with the first term in Eq. 2.
We note that because the entropy function is
convex, we can get a lower bound on H(q):
H(q)  r
i=1 iH(qi) = r
i=1 iH(qi(, y))
Substituting the modified entropy term into
Eq. 2 still yields a lower bound on the likelihood. This change makes the E-step tractable,
because each distribution qi(y) can be computed
separately by optimizing a bound which depends
only on the variational parameters in that distribution. In fact, the bound on the left hand side in
Proposition 1 becomes the function that we optimize instead of G(q, ).
Without proper constraints, the  update can be
intractable as well. It requires maximizing a linear objective (in ) while constraining the  to
be from a particular subspace of the probability
simplex, ~ r(t). To solve this issue, we require
that ~ r(t) is polyhedral, making it possible to apply linear programming (Boyd and Vandenberghe,
2004).
The bound we optimize is:2

with   ~ r(tfinal) and (qi(, y))  Qi. The
algorithm for optimizing this bound is in Fig. 1,
which includes an extra M-step to optimize  (see
extended report).
3 Experiments
We tested our method on the unsupervised learning problem of dependency grammar induction.
For the generative model, we used the dependency
model with valence as it appears in Klein and Manning (2004). We used the data from the Chinese treebank (Xue et al., 2004). Following standard practice, sentences were stripped of words
and punctuation, leaving part-of-speech tags for
the unsupervised induction of dependency structure, and sentences of length more than 10 were
removed from the set. We experimented with
a Dirichlet prior over the parameters and logistic normal priors over the parameters, and found
the latter to still be favorable with our method, as
in Cohen et al. (2008). We therefore report results
with our method only for the logistic normal prior.
We do inference on sections 1�270 and 301�1151
of CTB10 (4,909 sentences) by running the EM algorithm for 20 iterations, for which all algorithms
have their variational bound converge.
To evaluate performance, we report the fraction
of words whose predicted parent matches the gold
standard (attachment accuracy). For parsing, we
use the minimum Bayes risk parse.
Our mixture components Qi are based on simple
linguistic tendencies of Chinese syntax. These observations include the tendency of dependencies to
(a) emanate from the right of the current position
and (b) connect words which are nearby (in string
distance). We experiment with six mixture components: (1) RIGHTATTACH: Each word's parent
is to the word's right. The root, therefore, is always the rightmost word; (2) ALLRIGHT: The
rightmost word is the parent of all positions in the
sentence (there is only one such tree); (3) LEFTCHAIN: The tree forms a chain, such that each

LEFTCHAIN as a parsing model (attaches each word to the
word on its right), non-Bayesian EM, and mean-field variational EM without any constraints. These are compared
against the six mixture components mentioned in the text. (I)

mixture coefficients. With the last row, 2 to 4 are always

word is governed by the word to its right; (4) VERBASROOT: Only verbs can attach to the wall node
$; (5) NOUNSEQUENCE: Every sequence of n NN
(nouns) is assumed to be a noun phrase, hence the
first n-1 NNs are attached to the last NN; and (6)
SHORTDEP: Allow only dependencies of length
four or less. This is a strict model reminiscent
of the successful application of structural bias to
grammar induction (Smith and Eisner, 2006).
These components are added to a variational
DMV model without the sum-to-1 constraint on
. This complements variational techniques which
state that the optimal solution during the E-step
for the mean-field variational EM algorithm is a
weighted grammar of the same form of p(x, y | )
(DMV in our case). Using the mixture components this way has the effect of smoothing the estimated grammar event counts during the E-step, in
the direction of some prior expectations.
Let 1 correspond to the component of the original DMV model, and let 2 correspond to one of
the components from the above list. Variational
techniques show that if we let 1 obtain the value
1, then the optimal solution will be 1 = 1 and
2 = 0. We therefore restrict 1 to be smaller than
1. More specifically, we use an annealing process
which starts by limiting 1 to be  s = 0.85 (and
hence limits 2 to be  0.15) and increases s at
each step by 1% until s reaches 0.95. In addition,
we also ran the algorithm with 1 fixed at 0.85 and
1 fixed at 0.95 to check the effectiveness of annealing on the simplex.
Table 1 describes the results of our experiments. In general, using additional mixture components has a clear advantage over the mean-field
assumption. The best result with a single mixture is achieved with annealing, and the VERBASROOT component. A combination of the mixtures (RIGHTATTACH) together with VERBASROOT and SHORTDEP led to an additional improvement, implying that proper selection of several mixture components together can achieve a
performance gain.
4 Conclusion
We described a variational EM algorithm that uses
a mixture model for the variational model. We
refined the algorithm with an annealing mechanism to avoid local maxima. We demonstrated
the effectiveness of the algorithm on a dependency
grammar induction task. Our results show that
with a good choice of mixture components and
annealing schedule, we achieve improvements for
this task over mean-field variational inference.
