Abstract
We present an unsupervised learning algorithm that mines large text corpora for
patterns that express implicit semantic relations. For a given input word pair
Y
X : with some unspecified semantic
relations, the corresponding output list of
patterns m
P
P ,
,
1 is ranked according
to how well each pattern i
P expresses the
relations between X and Y . For example, given ostrich
=
X and bird
=
Y , the
two highest ranking output patterns are
"X is the largest Y" and "Y such as the
X". The output patterns are intended to
be useful for finding further pairs with
the same relations, to support the construction of lexicons, ontologies, and semantic networks. The patterns are sorted
by pertinence, where the pertinence of a
pattern i
P for a word pair Y
X : is the
expected relational similarity between the
given pair and typical pairs for i
P . The
algorithm is empirically evaluated on two
tasks, solving multiple-choice SAT word
analogy questions and classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs. On
both tasks, the algorithm achieves stateof-the-art results, performing significantly better than several alternative pattern ranking algorithms, based on tf-idf.
1 Introduction
In a widely cited paper, Hearst (1992) showed
that the lexico-syntactic pattern "Y such as the
X" can be used to mine large text corpora for
word pairs Y
X : in which X is a hyponym (type)
of Y. For example, if we search in a large corpus
using the pattern "Y such as the X" and we find
the string "bird such as the ostrich", then we can
infer that "ostrich" is a hyponym of "bird". Berland and Charniak (1999) demonstrated that the
patterns "Y's X" and "X of the Y" can be used to
mine corpora for pairs Y
X : in which X is a
meronym (part) of Y (e.g., "wheel of the car").
Here we consider the inverse of this problem:
Given a word pair Y
X : with some unspecified
semantic relations, can we mine a large text corpus for lexico-syntactic patterns that express the
implicit relations between X and Y ? For example, if we are given the pair ostrich:bird, can we
discover the pattern "Y such as the X"? We are
particularly interested in discovering high quality
patterns that are reliable for mining further word
pairs with the same semantic relations.
In our experiments, we use a corpus of web
pages containing about 10
10
5� English words
(Terra and Clarke, 2003). From co-occurrences
of the pair ostrich:bird in this corpus, we can
generate 516 patterns of the form "X ... Y" and
452 patterns of the form "Y ... X". Most of these
patterns are not very useful for text mining. The
main challenge is to find a way of ranking the
patterns, so that patterns like "Y such as the X"
are highly ranked. Another challenge is to find a
way to empirically evaluate the performance of
any such pattern ranking algorithm.
For a given input word pair Y
X : with some
unspecified semantic relations, we rank the corresponding output list of patterns m
P
P ,
,
1 in
order of decreasing pertinence. The pertinence of
a pattern i
P for a word pair Y
X : is the expected
relational similarity between the given pair and
typical pairs that fit i
P . We define pertinence
more precisely in Section 2.
Hearst (1992) suggests that her work may be
useful for building a thesaurus. Berland and
Charniak (1999) suggest their work may be useful for building a lexicon or ontology, like
WordNet. Our algorithm is also applicable to
these tasks. Other potential applications and related problems are discussed in Section 3.
To calculate pertinence, we must be able to
measure relational similarity. Our measure is
based on Latent Relational Analysis (Turney,
2005). The details are given in Section 4.
Given a word pair Y
X : , we want our algorithm to rank the corresponding list of patterns
313

1 according to their value for mining
text, in support of semantic network construction
and similar tasks. Unfortunately, it is difficult to
measure performance on such tasks. Therefore
our experiments are based on two tasks that provide objective performance measures.
In Section 5, ranking algorithms are compared
by their performance on solving multiple-choice
SAT word analogy questions. In Section 6, they
are compared by their performance on classifying semantic relations in noun-modifier pairs.
The experiments demonstrate that ranking by
pertinence is significantly better than several alternative pattern ranking algorithms, based on
tf-idf. The performance of pertinence on these
two tasks is slightly below the best performance
that has been reported so far (Turney, 2005), but
the difference is not statistically significant.
We discuss the results in Section 7 and conclude in Section 8.
2 Pertinence
The relational similarity between two pairs of
words, 1
1 :Y
X and 2
2 :Y
X , is the degree to
which their semantic relations are analogous. For
example, mason:stone and carpenter:wood have
a high degree of relational similarity. Measuring
relational similarity will be discussed in Section 4. For now, assume that we have a measure
of the relational similarity between pairs of
words,

If a pattern with high pertinence is used for

follows from the definition of pertinence. We
believe this definition is the first formal measure
of quality for text mining patterns.

3 Related Work
Hearst (1992) describes a method for finding
patterns like "Y such as the X", but her method
requires human judgement. Berland and
Charniak (1999) use Hearst's manual procedure.
Riloff and Jones (1999) use a mutual bootstrapping technique that can find patterns automatically, but the bootstrapping requires an initial seed of manually chosen examples for each
class of words. Miller et al. (2000) propose an
approach to relation extraction that was evaluated in the Seventh Message Understanding Conference (MUC7). Their algorithm requires labeled examples of each relation. Similarly, Zelenko et al. (2003) use a supervised kernel
method that requires labeled training examples.
Agichtein and Gravano (2000) also require training examples for each relation. Brin (1998) uses
bootstrapping from seed examples of author:title
pairs to discover patterns for mining further pairs.
Yangarber et al. (2000) and Yangarber (2003)
present an algorithm that can find patterns automatically, but it requires an initial seed of manually designed patterns for each semantic relation.
Stevenson (2004) uses WordNet to extract relations from text, but also requires initial seed patterns for each relation.
314
Lapata (2002) examines the task of expressing
the implicit relations in nominalizations, which
are noun compounds whose head noun is derived
from a verb and whose modifier can be interpreted as an argument of the verb. In contrast
with this work, our algorithm is not restricted to
nominalizations. Section 6 shows that our algorithm works with arbitrary noun compounds and
the SAT questions in Section 5 include all nine
possible pairings of nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
As far as we know, our algorithm is the first
unsupervised learning algorithm that can find
patterns for semantic relations, given only a large
corpus (e.g., in our experiments, about 10
10
5�
words) and a moderately sized set of word pairs
(e.g., 600 or more pairs in the experiments), such
that the members of each pair appear together
frequently in short phrases in the corpus. These
word pairs are not seeds, since the algorithm
does not require the pairs to be labeled or
grouped; we do not assume they are homogenous.
The word pairs that we need could be generated automatically, by searching for word pairs
that co-occur frequently in the corpus. However,
our evaluation methods (Sections 5 and 6) both
involve a predetermined list of word pairs. If our
algorithm were allowed to generate its own word
pairs, the overlap with the predetermined lists
would likely be small. This is a limitation of our
evaluation methods rather than the algorithm.
Since any two word pairs may have some relations in common and some that are not shared,
our algorithm generates a unique list of patterns
for each input word pair. For example, mason:stone and carpenter:wood share the pattern
"X carves Y", but the patterns "X nails Y" and
"X bends Y" are unique to carpenter:wood. The
ranked list of patterns for a word pair Y
X :
gives the relations between X and Y in the corpus,
sorted with the most pertinent (i.e., characteristic,
distinctive, unambiguous) relations first.
Turney (2005) gives an algorithm for measuring the relational similarity between two pairs of
words, called Latent Relational Analysis (LRA).
This algorithm can be used to solve multiplechoice word analogy questions and to classify
noun-modifier pairs (Turney, 2005), but it does
not attempt to express the implicit semantic relations. Turney (2005) maps each pair Y
X : to a
high-dimensional vector v . The value of each
element i
v in v is based on the frequency, for
the pair Y
X : , of a corresponding pattern i
P .
The relational similarity between two pairs,
1
1 :Y
X and 2
2 :Y
X , is derived from the cosine of
the angle between their two vectors. A limitation
of this approach is that the semantic content of
the vectors is difficult to interpret; the magnitude
of an element i
v is not a good indicator of how
well the corresponding pattern i
P expresses a
relation of Y
X : . This claim is supported by the
experiments in Sections 5 and 6.
Pertinence (as defined in Section 2) builds on
the measure of relational similarity in Turney
(2005), but it has the advantage that the semantic
content can be interpreted; we can point to specific patterns and say that they express the implicit relations. Furthermore, we can use the patterns to find other pairs with the same relations.
Hearst (1992) processed her text with a partof-speech tagger and a unification-based constituent analyzer. This makes it possible to use
more general patterns. For example, instead of
the literal string pattern "Y such as the X", where
X and Y are words, Hearst (1992) used the more
abstract pattern " 0
NP such as 1
NP ", where i
NP
represents a noun phrase. For the sake of simplicity, we have avoided part-of-speech tagging,
which limits us to literal patterns. We plan to
experiment with tagging in future work.

ranked lists of patterns m

1 for each input
pair. The following steps are similar to the algorithm of Turney (2005), with several changes to
support the calculation of pertinence.
1. Find phrases: For each pair i
i Y
X : , make a
list of phrases in the corpus that contain the pair.
We use the Waterloo MultiText System (Clarke
et al., 1998) to search in a corpus of about
10
10
5� English words (Terra and Clarke, 2003).
Make one list of phrases that begin with i
X and
end with i
Y and a second list for the opposite
order. Each phrase must have one to three intervening words between i
X and i
Y . The first and
last words in the phrase do not need to exactly
match i
X and i
Y . The MultiText query language
allows different suffixes. Veale (2004) has observed that it is easier to identify semantic relations between nouns than between other parts of
speech. Therefore we use WordNet 2.0 (Miller,
1995) to guess whether i
X and i
Y are likely to
be nouns. When they are nouns, we are relatively
strict about suffixes; we only allow variation in
pluralization. For all other parts of speech, we
are liberal about suffixes. For example, we allow
an adjective such as "inflated" to match a noun
such as "inflation". With MultiText, the query
"inflat*" matches both "inflated" and "inflation".
2. Generate patterns: For each list of phrases,
generate a list of patterns, based on the phrases.
Replace the first word in each phrase with the
generic marker "X" and replace the last word
with "Y". The intervening words in each phrase
315
may be either left as they are or replaced with the
wildcard "*". For example, the phrase "carpenter
nails the wood" yields the patterns "X nails the
Y", "X nails * Y", "X * the Y", and "X * * Y".
Do not allow duplicate patterns in a list, but note
the number of times a pattern is generated for
each word pair i
i Y
X : in each order ( i
X first and
i
Y last or vice versa). We call this the pattern
frequency. It is a local frequency count, analogous to term frequency in information retrieval.
3. Count pair frequency: The pair frequency
for a pattern is the number of lists from the preceding step that contain the given pattern. It is a
global frequency count, analogous to document
frequency in information retrieval. Note that a
pair i
i Y
X : yields two lists of phrases and hence
two lists of patterns. A given pattern might appear in zero, one, or two of the lists for i
i Y
X : .
4. Map pairs to rows: In preparation for building a matrix X , create a mapping of word pairs
to row numbers. For each pair i
i Y
X : , create a
row for i
i Y
X : and another row for i
i X
Y : . If W
does not already contain }
:
,
,
:
{ 1
1 n
n X
Y
X
Y ,
then we have effectively doubled the number of
word pairs, which increases the sample size for
calculating pertinence.
5. Map patterns to columns: Create a mapping
of patterns to column numbers. For each unique
pattern of the form "X ... Y" from Step 2, create
a column for the original pattern "X ... Y" and
another column for the same pattern with X and
Y swapped, "Y ... X". Step 2 can generate millions of distinct patterns. The experiment in Section 5 results in 1,706,845 distinct patterns,
yielding 3,413,690 columns. This is too many
columns for matrix operations with today's standard desktop computer. Most of the patterns have
a very low pair frequency. For the experiment in
Section 5, 1,371,702 of the patterns have a pair
frequency of one. To keep the matrix X manageable, we drop all patterns with a pair frequency less than ten. For Section 5, this leaves
42,032 patterns, yielding 84,064 columns. Turney (2005) limited the matrix to 8,000 columns,
but a larger pool of patterns is better for our purposes, since it increases the likelihood of finding
good patterns for expressing the semantic relations of a given word pair.
6. Build a sparse matrix: Build a matrix X in
sparse matrix format. The value for the cell in
row i and column j is the pattern frequency of the
j-th pattern for the the i-th word pair.
7. Calculate entropy: Apply log and entropy
transformations to the sparse matrix X (Landauer and Dumais, 1997). Each cell is replaced
with its logarithm, multiplied by a weight based
on the negative entropy of the corresponding
column vector in the matrix. This gives more
weight to patterns that vary substantially in frequency for each pair.
8. Apply SVD: After log and entropy transforms,
apply the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
to X (Golub and Van Loan, 1996). SVD decomposes X into a product of three matrices
T
V
U , where U and V are in column orthonormal form (i.e., the columns are orthogonal
and have unit length) and  is a diagonal matrix
of singular values (hence SVD). If X is of rank
r , then  is also of rank r . Let k
 , where
r
k < , be the diagonal matrix formed from the
top k singular values, and let k
U and k
V be the
matrices produced by selecting the corresponding columns from U and V . The matrix
T
k
k
k V
U  is the matrix of rank k that best approximates the original matrix X , in the sense
that it minimizes the approximation errors
(Golub and Van Loan, 1996). Following Landauer and Dumais (1997), we use 300
=
k . We
may think of this matrix T
k
k
k V
U  as a smoothed
version of the original matrix. SVD is used to
reduce noise and compensate for sparseness
(Landauer and Dumais, 1997).

log and entropy transforms, calculate the conditional probability )

X implies that the pattern j
P does not actually appear
with the word pair i
i Y
X : in the corpus; we are
only guessing that the pattern is appropriate for
the word pair, and we could be wrong. Therefore
we prefer to limit ourselves to patterns and word
pairs that have actually been observed in the corpus. For each pair i
i Y
X : in W, output two separate ranked lists, one for patterns of the form
"X ... Y" and another for patterns of the form
316
"Y ... X", where the patterns in both lists are
sorted in order of decreasing pertinence to i
i Y
X : .
Ranking serves as a kind of normalization. We
have found that the relative rank of a pattern is
more reliable as an indicator of its importance
than the absolute pertinence. This is analogous to
information retrieval, where documents are
ranked in order of their relevance to a query. The
relative rank of a document is more important
than its actual numerical score (which is usually
hidden from the user of a search engine). Having
two separate ranked lists helps to avoid bias. For
example, ostrich:bird generates 516 patterns of
the form "X ... Y" and 452 patterns of the form
"Y ... X". Since there are more patterns of the
form "X ... Y", there is a slight bias towards
these patterns. If the two lists were merged, the
"Y ... X" patterns would be at a disadvantage.
5 Experiments with Word Analogies
In these experiments, we evaluate pertinence using 374 college-level multiple-choice word
analogies, taken from the SAT test. For each
question, there is a target word pair, called the
stem pair, and five choice pairs. The task is to
find the choice that is most analogous (i.e., has
the highest relational similarity) to the stem. This
choice pair is called the solution and the other
choices are distractors. Since there are six word
pairs per question (the stem and the five choices),
there are 2244
6
374 =
� pairs in the input set W.
In Step 4 of the algorithm, we double the pairs,
but we also drop some pairs because they do not
co-occur in the corpus. This leaves us with 4194
rows in the matrix. As mentioned in Step 5, the
matrix has 84,064 columns (patterns). The sparse
matrix density is 0.91%.
To answer a SAT question, we generate
ranked lists of patterns for each of the six word
pairs. Each choice is evaluated by taking the intersection of its patterns with the stem's patterns.
The shared patterns are scored by the average of
their rank in the stem's lists and the choice's lists.
Since the lists are sorted in order of decreasing
pertinence, a low score means a high pertinence.
Our guess is the choice with the lowest scoring
shared pattern.
Table 1 shows three examples, two questions
that are answered correctly followed by one that
is answered incorrectly. The correct answers are
in bold font. For the first question, the stem is
ostrich:bird and the best choice is (a) lion:cat.
The highest ranking pattern that is shared by both
of these pairs is "Y such as the X". The third
question illustrates that, even when the answer is
incorrect, the best shared pattern ("Y powered *
* X") may be plausible.
Word pair Best shared pattern Score
1. ostrich:bird
(a) lion:cat "Y such as the X" 1.0
(b) goose:flock "X * * breeding Y" 43.5
(c) ewe:sheep "X are the only Y" 13.5
(d) cub:bear "Y are called X" 29.0
(e) primate:monkey "Y is the * X" 80.0
2. traffic:street
(a) ship:gangplank "X * down the Y" 53.0
(b) crop:harvest "X * adjacent * Y" 248.0
(c) car:garage "X * a residential Y" 63.0
(d) pedestrians:feet "Y * accommodate X" 23.0
(e) water:riverbed "Y that carry X" 17.0
3. locomotive:train
(a) horse:saddle "X carrying * Y" 82.0
(b) tractor:plow "X pulled * Y" 7.0
(c) rudder:rowboat "Y * X" 319.0
(d) camel:desert "Y with two X" 43.0
(e) gasoline:automobile "Y powered * * X" 5.0
Table 1. Three examples of SAT questions.
Table 2 shows the four highest ranking patterns for the stem and solution for the first example. The pattern "X lion Y" is anomalous, but the
other patterns seem reasonable. The shared pattern "Y such as the X" is ranked 1 for both pairs,
hence the average score for this pattern is 1.0, as
shown in Table 1. Note that the "ostrich is the
largest bird" and "lions are large cats", but the
largest cat is the Siberian tiger.
Word pair "X ... Y" "Y ... X"
ostrich:bird "X is the largest Y" "Y such as the X"
"X is * largest Y" "Y such * the X"
lion:cat "X lion Y" "Y such as the X"
"X are large Y" "Y and mountain X"

In Table 4, we compare ranking patterns by
pertinence to ranking by various other measures,
mostly based on varieties of tf-idf (term frequency times inverse document frequency, a
common way to rank documents in information
retrieval). The tf-idf measures are taken from
Salton and Buckley (1988). For comparison, we
also include three algorithms that do not rank
317
patterns (the bottom three rows in the table).
These three algorithms can answer the SAT
questions, but they do not provide any kind of
explanation for their answers.

Table 4. Performance of various algorithms on SAT.
All of the pattern ranking algorithms are given
exactly the same sets of patterns to rank. Any
differences in performance are due to the ranking
method alone. The algorithms may skip questions when the word pairs do not co-occur in the
corpus. All of the ranking algorithms skip the
same set of 15 of the 374 SAT questions. Precision is defined as the percentage of correct answers out of the questions that were answered
(not skipped). Recall is the percentage of correct
answers out of the maximum possible number
correct (374). The F measure is the harmonic
mean of precision and recall.
For the tf-idf methods in Table 4, f is the pattern frequency, n is the pair frequency, F is the
maximum f for all patterns for the given word
pair, and N is the total number of word pairs. By
"TF = f, IDF = n
/
1 ", for example (row 8), we
mean that f plays a role that is analogous to term
frequency and n
/
1 plays a role that is analogous
to inverse document frequency. That is, in row 8,
the patterns are ranked in decreasing order of
pattern frequency divided by pair frequency.
Table 4 also shows some ranking methods
based on intermediate calculations in the algorithm in Section 4. For example, row 2 in Table 4
gives the results when patterns are ranked in order of decreasing values in the corresponding
cells of the matrix X from Step 7.
Row 12 in Table 4 shows the results we would
get using Latent Relational Analysis (Turney,
2005) to rank patterns. The results in row 12
support the claim made in Section 3, that LRA is
not suitable for ranking patterns, although it
works well for answering the SAT questions (as
we see in row 16). The vectors in LRA yield a
good measure of relational similarity, but the
magnitude of the value of a specific element in a
vector is not a good indicator of the quality of the
corresponding pattern.
The best method for ranking patterns is pertinence (row 1 in Table 4). As a point of comparison, the performance of the average senior
highschool student on the SAT analogies is about
57% (Turney and Littman, 2005). The second
best method is to use the values in the matrix X
after the log and entropy transformations in
Step 7 (row 2). The difference between these two
methods is statistically significant with 95% confidence. Pertinence (row 1) performs slightly
below Latent Relational Analysis (row 16; Turney, 2005), but the difference is not significant.
Randomly guessing answers should yield an F
of 20% (1 out of 5 choices), but ranking patterns
randomly (row 13) results in an F of 26.4%. This
is because the stem pair tends to share more patterns with the solution pair than with the distractors. The minimum of a large set of random
numbers is likely to be lower than the minimum
of a small set of random numbers.
6 Experiments with Noun-Modifiers
In these experiments, we evaluate pertinence on
the task of classifying noun-modifier pairs. The
problem is to classify a noun-modifier pair, such
as "flu virus", according to the semantic relation
between the head noun (virus) and the modifier
(flu). For example, "flu virus" is classified as a
causality relation (the flu is caused by a virus).
For these experiments, we use a set of 600
manually labeled noun-modifier pairs (Nastase
and Szpakowicz, 2003). There are five general
classes of labels with thirty subclasses. We present here the results with five classes; the results
with thirty subclasses follow the same trends
(that is, pertinence performs significantly better
than the other ranking methods). The five classes
are causality (storm cloud), temporality (daily
exercise), spatial (desert storm), participant
(student protest), and quality (expensive book).
The input set W consists of the 600 nounmodifier pairs. This set is doubled in Step 4, but
we drop some pairs because they do not co-occur
in the corpus, leaving us with 1184 rows in the
matrix. There are 16,849 distinct patterns with a
pair frequency of ten or more, resulting in 33,698
columns. The matrix density is 2.57%.
318
To classify a noun-modifier pair, we use a single nearest neighbour algorithm with leave-oneout cross-validation. We split the set 600 times.
Each pair gets a turn as the single testing example, while the other 599 pairs serve as training
examples. The testing example is classified according to the label of its nearest neighbour in
the training set. The distance between two nounmodifier pairs is measured by the average rank of
their best shared pattern. Table 5 shows the resulting precision, recall, and F, when ranking
patterns by pertinence.
Class name Prec. Rec. F Class size
causality 37.3 36.0 36.7 86
participant 61.1 64.4 62.7 260
quality 49.3 50.7 50.0 146
spatial 43.9 32.7 37.5 56
temporality 64.7 63.5 64.1 52
all 51.3 49.5 50.2 600
Table 5. Performance on noun-modifiers.
To gain some insight into the algorithm, we
examined the 600 best shared patterns for each
pair and its single nearest neighbour. For each of
the five classes, Table 6 lists the most frequent
pattern among the best shared patterns for the
given class. All of these patterns seem appropriate for their respective classes.
Class Most frequent pattern Example pair
causality "Y * causes X" "cold virus"
participant "Y of his X" "dream analysis"
quality "Y made of X" "copper coin"
spatial "X * * terrestrial Y" "aquatic mammal"
temporality "Y in * early X" "morning frost"
Table 6. Most frequent of the best shared patterns.
Table 7 gives the performance of pertinence
on the noun-modifier problem, compared to
various other pattern ranking methods. The bottom two rows are included for comparison; they
are not pattern ranking algorithms. The best
method for ranking patterns is pertinence (row 1
in Table 7). The difference between pertinence
and the second best ranking method (row 2) is
statistically significant with 95% confidence.
Latent Relational Analysis (row 16) performs
slightly better than pertinence (row 1), but the
difference is not statistically significant.
Row 6 in Table 7 shows the results we would
get using Latent Relational Analysis (Turney,
2005) to rank patterns. Again, the results support
the claim in Section 3, that LRA is not suitable
for ranking patterns. LRA can classify the nounmodifiers (as we see in row 16), but it cannot
express the implicit semantic relations that make
an unlabeled noun-modifier in the testing set
similar to its nearest neighbour in the training set.

7 Discussion
Computing pertinence took about 18 hours for
the experiments in Section 5 and 9 hours for Section 6. In both cases, the majority of the time was
spent in Step 1, using MultiText (Clarke et al.,
1998) to search through the corpus of 10
10
5�
words. MultiText was running on a Beowulf
cluster with sixteen 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon CPUs.
The corpus and the search index require about
one terabyte of disk space. This may seem computationally demanding by today's standards, but
progress in hardware will soon allow an average
desktop computer to handle corpora of this size.
Although the performance on the SAT analogy questions (54.6%) is near the level of the
average senior highschool student (57%), there is
room for improvement. For applications such as
building a thesaurus, lexicon, or ontology, this
level of performance suggests that our algorithm
could assist, but not replace, a human expert.
One possible improvement would be to add
part-of-speech tagging or parsing. We have done
some preliminary experiments with parsing and
plan to explore tagging as well. A difficulty is
that much of the text in our corpus does not consist of properly formed sentences, since the text
comes from web pages. This poses problems for
most part-of-speech taggers and parsers.
8 Conclusion
Latent Relational Analysis (Turney, 2005) provides a way to measure the relational similarity
between two word pairs, but it gives us little insight into how the two pairs are similar. In effect,
319
LRA is a black box. The main contribution of
this paper is the idea of pertinence, which allows
us to take an opaque measure of relational similarity and use it to find patterns that express the
implicit semantic relations between two words.
The experiments in Sections 5 and 6 show that
ranking patterns by pertinence is superior to
ranking them by a variety of tf-idf methods. On
the word analogy and noun-modifier tasks, pertinence performs as well as the state-of-the-art,
LRA, but pertinence goes beyond LRA by making relations explicit.
