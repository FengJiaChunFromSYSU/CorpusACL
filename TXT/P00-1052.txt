Abstract
Existing software systems for automated essay scoring can provide NLP researchers with opportunities
to test certain theoretical hypotheses, including some
derived from Centering Theory. In this study we employ ETS's e-rater essay scoring system to examine
whether local discourse coherence, as de ned by a
measure of Rough-Shift transitions, might be a signi cant contributor to the evaluation of essays. Our
positive results indicate that Rough-Shifts do indeed
capture a source of incoherence, one that has not been
closely examined in the Centering literature. These results not only justify Rough-Shifts as a valid transition
type, but they also support the original formulation of
Centering as a measure of discourse continuity even in
pronominal-free text.
1 Introduction
The task of evaluating student's writing ability has traditionally been a laborintensive human endeavor. However, several di erent software systems, e.g., PEG
Page and Peterson 1995, Intelligent Essay
Assessor 1 and e-rater
2, are now being used
to perform this task fully automatically. Furthermore, by at least one measure, these software systems evaluate student essays with the
same degree of accuracy as human experts.
That is, computer-generated scores tend to
match human expert scores as frequently as
two human scores match each other Burstein
et al., 1998.
Essay scoring systems such as these can
provide NLP researchers with opportunities
to test certain theoretical hypotheses and to
explore a variety of practical issues in computational linguistics. In this study, we employ
the e-rater essay scoring system to test a hy1

pothesis related to Centering Theory Joshi
and Weinstein, 1981; Grosz et al., 1983, inter alia. We focus on Centering Theory's
Rough-Shift transition which is the least well
studied among the four transition types. In
particular, we examine whether the discourse
coherence found in an essay, as de ned by a
measure of relative proportion of Rough-Shift
transitions, might be a signi cant contributor
to the accuracy of computer-generated essay
scores. Our positive nding validates the role
of the Rough-Shift transition and suggests a
route for exploring Centering Theory's practical applicability to writing evaluation and
instruction.
2 The e-rater essay scoring system
One goal of automatic essay scoring systems
such as e-rater is to represent the criteria that
human experts use to evaluate essays. The
writing features that e-rater evaluates were
speci cally chosen to re ect scoring criteria
for the essay portion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test GMAT. These criteria are articulated in GMAT test preparation materials at http: www.gmat.org. In
e-rater, syntactic variety is represented by
features that quantify occurrences of clause
types. Logical organization and clear transitions are represented by features that quantify cue words in certain syntactic constructions. The existence of main and supporting
points is represented by features that detect
where new points begin and where they are
developed. E-rater also includes features that
quantify the appropriateness of the vocabulary content of an essay.
One feature of writing valued by writing
experts that is not explicitly represented in
the current version of e-rater is local coherence. Centering Theory provides an algorithm for computing local coherence in written discourse. Our study investigates the applicability of Centering Theory's local coherence measure to essayevaluation by determining the e ect of adding this new feature to
e-rater's existing array of features.
3 Overview of Centering
A synthesis of two di erent lines of work
Joshi and Kuhn, 1979; Joshi and Weinstein,
1981 and Sidner, 1979; Grosz, 1977; Grosz
and Sidner, 1986 yielded the formulation
of Centering Theory as a model for monitoring local focus in discourse. The Centering model was designed to account for
those aspects of processing that are responsible for the di erence in the perceived coherence of discourses such as those demonstrated in 1 and 2 below examples from
Hudson-D'Zmura 1988.
1 a. John went to his favorite music store to
buy a piano.
b. He had frequented the store for many
years.
c. He was excited that he could nally buy a
piano.
d. He arrived just as the store was closing for
the day.
2 a. John went to his favorite music store to
buy a piano.
b. It was a store John had frequented for
many years.
c. He was excited that he could nally buy a
piano.
d. It was closing just as John arrived.
Discourse 1 is intuitively more coherent
than discourse 2. This di erence may be
seen to arise from the di erent degrees of continuity in what the discourse is about. Discourse 1 centers a single individual John
whereas discourse 2 seems to focus in and
out on di erent entities John, store, John,
store. Centering is designed to capture these
uctuations in continuity.
4 The Centering model
In this section, we present the basic definitions and common assumptions in Centering as discussed in the literature e.g.,
Walker et al. 1998. We present the assumptions and modi cations we made for this
study in Section 6.1.
4.1 Discourse segments and entities
Discourse consists of a sequence of textual
segments and each segment consists of a sequence of utterances. In Centering Theory, utterances are designated by Ui , Un.
Each utterance Ui evokes a set of discourse entities, the FORWARD-LOOKING
CENTERS, designated by CfUi. The
members of the Cf set are ranked according to discourse salience. Ranking is described in Section 4.4.The highest-ranked
member of the Cf set is the PREFERRED
CENTER, Cp. A BACKWARD-LOOKING
CENTER, Cb,is also identi ed for utterance
Ui. The highest ranked entity in the previous utterance, CfUi,1 , that is realized
in the current utterance, Ui, is its designated BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER,
Cb. The BACKWARD-LOOKING CENTER is a special member of the Cf set because
it represents the discourse entity that Ui is
about, what in the literature is often called
the 'topic' Reinhart, 1981; Horn, 1986.
The Cp for a given utterance may be identical with its Cb, but not necessarily so. It
is precisely this distinction between looking
back in the discourse with the Cb and projecting preferences for interpretations in the
subsequent discourse with the Cp that provides the key element in computing local coherence in discourse.
4.2 Centering transitions
Four types of transitions, re ecting four degrees of coherence, are de ned in Centering.
They are shown in transition ordering rule
1. The rules for computing the transitions
are shown in Table 1.
1 Transition ordering rule: Continue
is preferred to Retain, which is preferred to
Smooth-Shift, which is preferred to RoughShift.
Centering de nes one more rule, the Pronoun rule which we will discuss in detail in
Section 5.
CbUi=CbUi-1 CbUi6=CbUi-1
CbUi=Cp Continue Smooth-Shift
CbUi6=Cp Retain Rough-Shift
Table 1: Table of transitions
4.3 Utterance
In early formulations of Centering Theory,
the 'utterance' was not de ned explicitly. In
subsequent work Kameyama, 1998, the utterance was de ned as, roughly, the tensed
clause with relative clauses and clausal complements as exceptions. Based on crosslinguistic studies, Miltsakaki 1999 de ned the
utterance as the traditional 'sentence', i.e.,
the main clause and its accompanying subordinate and adjunct clauses constitute a single
utterance.
4.4 Cf ranking
As mentioned earlier, the PREFERRED
CENTER of an utterance is de ned as the
highest ranked member of the Cf set. The
ranking of the Cf members is determined
by the salience status of the entities in the
utterance and may vary crosslinguistically.
Kameyama 1985 and Brennan et al. 1987
proposed that the Cf ranking for English is
determined by grammatical function as follows:
2 Rule for ranking of
forward-looking centers: SUBJ IND.
OBJ OBJ OTHERS
Later crosslinguistic studies based on empirical work Di Eugenio, 1998; Turan, 1995;
Kameyama, 1985 determined the following
detailed ranking, with QIS standing for quanti ed inde nite subjects people, everyone
etc and PRO-ARB we, you for arbitrary
plural pronominals.
3Revised rule for the ranking of
forward-looking centers: SUBJ IND.
OBJ OBJ OTHERS QIS, PRO-ARB.
4.4.1 Complex NPs
In the case of complex NPs, which have
the property of evoking multiple discourse entities e.g. his mother, software industry,
the working hypothesis commonly assumed
e.g. Walker and Prince 1995 is ordering
from left to right.3
5 The role of Rough-Shift
transitions
As mentioned brie y earlier, the Centering
model includes one more rule, the Pronoun
Rule given in 4.
4 Pronoun Rule: If some element of
CfUi-1 is realized as a pronoun in Ui, then
so is the CbUi.
The Pronoun Rule re ects the intuition
that pronominals are felicitously used to refer to discourse-salient entities. As a result,
Cbs are often pronominalized, or even deleted
if the grammar allows it. Rule 4 then
predicts that if there is only one pronoun in
an utterance, this pronoun must realize the
Cb. The Pronoun Rule and the distribution
of forms de nite inde nite NPs and pronominals over transition types plays a signi cant
role in the development of anaphora resolution algorithms in NLP. Note that the utility
of the Pronoun Rule and the Centering transitions in anaphora resolution algorithms relies
heavily on the assumption that the texts under consideration are maximally coherent. In
maximally coherent texts, however, RoughShifts transitions are rare, and even in less
than maximally coherent texts they occur
infrequently. For this reason the distinction between Smooth-Shifts and Rough-Shifts
was collapsed in previous work Di Eugenio,
1998; Hurewitz, 1998, inter alia. The status
of Rough-Shift transitions in the Centering
model was therefore unclear, receiving only
negative evidence: Rough-Shifts are valid because they are found to be rare in coherent
discourse.
In this study we gain insights pertaining
to the nature of the Rough-Shifts precisely
because we are forced to drop the coherence
assumption. Our data consist of student essays whose degree of coherence is under evaluation and therefore cannot be assumed. Using students' paragraph marking as segment
boundaries, we 'centered' 100 GMAT essays.
The average length of these essays was about
3
But see also Di Eugenio 1998 for the treatment
of complex NPs in Italian.

Rough-Shifts 75 120 16

Table 2: Distribution of forms over Rough-Shifts
250 words. In the next section we show
that Rough-Shift transitions provide a reliable measure of incoherence, correlating well
with scores provided by writing experts.
One of the crucial insights was that, in
our data, the incoherence detected by the
Rough-Shift measure is not due to violations
of the Pronominal Rule or infelicitous use of
pronominal forms in general. In Table 2,
we report the results of the distribution of
forms over Rough-Shift transitions. Out of
the 211 Rough-Shift transitions, found in the
set of 100 essays, in 195 occasions the Cp
was a nominal phrase, either de nite or indefinite. Pronominals occurred in only 16 cases
of which 6 cases instantiated the pronominals
'we' or 'you' in their generic sense. Table 2
strongly indicates that student essays were
not incoherent in terms of the processing load
imposed on the reader to resolve anaphoric
references. Instead, the incoherence in the essays was due to discontinuities in students'
essays caused by their introducing too many
undeveloped topics within what should be a
conceptually uniform segment, i.e. their paragraphs. This is, in fact, what Rough-Shift
picked up.
These results not only justify Rough-Shifts
as a valid transition type but they also support the original formulation of Centering as
a measure of discourse continuity even when
anaphora resoluion is not an issue. It seems
that Rough-Shifts are capturing a source of
incoherence that has been overlooked in the
Centering literature. The processing load in
the Rough-Shift cases reported here is not
increased by the e ort required to resolve
anaphoric reference but instead by the e ort
required to nd the relevant topic connections
in a discourse bombarded with a rapid succession of multiple entities. That is, RoughShifts are the result of absent or extremely
short-lived Cbs. We interpret the RoughShift transitions in this context as a re ection
of the incoherence perceived by the reader
when s he is unable to identify the topic focus structure of the discourse. This is a
signi cant insight which opens up new avenues for practical applications of the Centering model.
6 The e-rater Centering study
In an earlier preliminary study, we applied the
Centering algorithm manually to a sample of
36 GMAT essays to explore the hypothesis
that the Centering model provides a reasonable measure of coherence or lack of re ecting the evaluation performed by human raters
with respect to the corresponding requirements described in the instructions for human
raters. We observed that essays with higher
scores tended to have signi cantly lower percentages of ROUGH-SHIFTs than essays with
lower scores. As expected, the distribution of
the other types of transitions was not significant. In general, CONTINUEs, RETAINs,
and SMOOTH-SHIFTs do not yield incoherent discourses in fact, an essay with only
CONTINUE transitions might sound rather
boring!.
In this study we test the hypothesis that
a predictor variable derived from Centering
can signi cantly improve the performance of
e-rater. Since we are in fact proposing Centering's ROUGH-SHIFTs as a predictor variable, our model, strictly speaking, measures
incoherence.
The corpus for our study came from a
pool of essays written by students taking the
GMAT test. We randomly selected a total
of 100 essays, covering the full range of the
scoring scale, where 1 is lowest and 6 is highest see appendix. We applied the Centering algorithm to all 100 essays, calculated the
percentage of ROUGH-SHIFTs in each essay
and then ran multiple regression to evaluate
the contribution of the proposed variable to
the e-rater's performance.
6.1 Centering assumptions and
modi cations
Utterance. Following Miltsakaki 1999, we
assume that the each utterance consists of one
main clause and all its subordinate and adjunct clauses.
Cf ranking. We assumed the Cf ranking
given in 3.
A modi cation we made involved the status of the pronominal I. 4We observed that
in low-scored essays the rst person pronominal I was used extensively, normally presenting personal narratives. However, personal
narratives were unsuited to this essay writing
task and were assigned lower scores by expert readers. The extensive use of I in the
subject position produced an unwanted e ect
of high coherence. We prescriptively decided
to penalize the use of I's in order to better
re ect the coherence demands made by the
particular writing task. The way to penalize was to omit I's. As a result, coherence
was measured with respect to the treatment
of the remaining entities in the I-containing
utterances. This gave us the desired result of
being able to distinguish those I-containing
utterances which made coherent transitions
with respect to the entities they were talking
about and those that did not.

In fact, a similar modi cation has been proposed

text.
tremely hard to identify in an accurate and
principled way. Furthermore, existing algorithms Morris and Hirst, 1991; Youmans,
1991; Hearst, 1994; Kozima, 1993; Reynar,
1994; Passonneau and Litman, 1997; Passonneau, 1998 rely heavily on the assumption of
textual coherence. In our case, textual coherence cannot be assumed. Given that text organization is also part of the evaluation of the
essays, we decided to use the students' paragraph breaks to locate segment boundaries.
6.2 Implementation
For this study, we decided to manually tag
coreferring expressions despite the availability of coreference algorithms. We made this
decision because a poor performance of the
coreference algorithm would give us distorted
results and we would not be able to test our
hypothesis. For the same reason, we manually tagged the Preferred centers as Cp. We
only needed to mark all the other entities as
OTHER. This information was adequate for
the computation of the Cb and all of the transitions.
Discourse segmentation and the implementation of the Centering algorithm for the computation of the transitions were automated.
Segments boundaries were marked at paragraph breaks and the transitions were calculated according to the instructions given in
Table 1. As output, the system computed
the percentage of Rough-Shifts for each essay. The percentage of Rough-Shifts was calculated as the number of Rough-Shifts over
the total number of identi ed transitions in
the essay.
7 Study results
In the appendix, we give the percentages of
Rough-Shifts ROUGH for each of the actual
student essays 100 on which we tested the
ROUGH variable in the regression discussed
below. The HUMAN HUM column contains the essay scores given by human raters
and the EARTER E-R column contains the
corresponding score assigned by the e-rater.
Comparing HUMAN and ROUGH, we observe that essays with scores from the higher
end of the scale tend to have lower percentages of Rough-Shifts than the ones from the
lower end. To evaluate that this observation can be utilized to improve the e-rater's
performance, we regressed X=E-RATER and
X=ROUGH the predictors by Y=HUMAN.
The results of the regression are shown in Table 3. The 'Estimate' cell contains the coefcients assigned for each variable. The coefcient for ROUGH is negative, thus penalizing occurrences of Rough-Shifts in the essays.
The t-test 't-ratio' in Table 3 for ROUGH
has a highly signi cant p-value p 0.0013for
these 100 essays suggesting that the added
variable ROUGH can contribute to the accuracy of the model. The magnitude of the
contribution indicated by this regression is
approximately 0.5 point, a reasonalby sizable e ect given the scoring scale 1-6. Additional work is needed to precisely quantify the contribution of ROUGH. That would
involve incorporating the ROUGH variable
into the building of a new e-rater model and
comapring the results of the new model to the
original e-rater model.
As a preliminary test of the predictability
of the model, we jacknifed the data. We performed 100 tests with ERATER as the sole
variable leaving out one essay each time and
recorded the prediction of the model for that
essay. We repeated the procedure using both
variables. The predicted values for ERATER
alone and ERATER+ROUGH are shown in
columns PrH E and PrH E+R respectively
in Table 4. In comparing the predictions, we
observe that, indeed, 57  of the predicted
values shown in the PrH E+R column are
better approximations of the HUMAN scores,
especially in the cases where the ERATER's
score is discrepant by 2 points from the HUMAN score.
8 Discussion
Our positive nding, namely that Centering
Theory's measure of relative proportion of
Rough-Shift transitions is indeed a signi cant contributor to the accuracy of computergenerated essay scores, has several practical
and theoretical implications. Clearly, it indicates that adding a local coherence feature
to e-rater could signi cantly improve e-rater's
scoring accuracy. Note, however, that overall scores and coherence scores need not be
strongly correlated. Indeed, our data contain
several examples of essays with high coherence scores but low overall scores and vice
versa.
We brie y reviewed these cases with several
ETS writing assessment experts to gain their
insights into the value of pursuing this work
further. In an e ort to maximize the use of
their time with us, we carefully selected three
pairs of essays to elicit speci c information.
One pair included two high-scoring 6 essays,
one with a high coherence score and the other
with a low coherence score. Another pair included two essays with low coherence scores
but di ering overall scores a 5 and a 6. A
nal pair was carefully chosen to include one
essay with an overall score of 3 that made
several main points but did not develop them
fully or coherently, and another essay with an
overall score of 4 that made only one main
point but did develop it fully and coherently.
After brie y describing the Rough-Shift coherence measure and without revealing either
the overall scores or the coherence scores of
the essay pairs, we asked our experts for their
comments on the overall scores and coherence
of the essays. In all cases, our experts precisely identi ed the scores the essays had been
given. In the rst case, they agreed with the
high Centering coherence measure, but one
expert disagreed with the low Centering coherence measure. For that essay, one expert
noted that "coherence comes and goes" while
another found coherence in a "chronological
organization of examples" a notion beyond
the domain of Centering Theory. In the second case, our experts' judgments con rmed
the Rough-Shift coherence measure. In the
third case, our experts speci cally identi ed
both the coherence and the development aspects as determinants of the essays' scores. In
general, our experts felt that the development
of an automated coherence measure would be
a useful instructional aid.
The advantage of the Rough-Shift metric
over other quanti ed components of the erater is that it can be appropriately translated
into instructive feedback for the student. In
an interactive tutorial system, segments containing Rough-Shift transitions can be highlighted and supplementary instructional comments will guide the student into revising the
relevant section paying attention to topic discontinuities.
9 Future work
Our study prescribes a route for several future research projects. Some, such as the
need to improve on fully automated techniques for noun phrase discourse entity identi cation and coreference resolution, are essential for converting this measure of local coherence to a fully automated procedure. Others, not explicitly discussed here, such as the
status of discourse deictic expressions, nominalization resolution, and global coherence
studies are fair game for basic, theoretical research.

Table 4: Table with the human scores HUM, the e-rater scores E-R, the Rough-Shift measure ROUGH,
the jacknifed predicted values using e-rater as the only variable PrH E and the jacknifed predicted values
using the e-rater and the added variable Rough-Shift PrH E+R. The ROUGH measure is the percentage of
Rough-Shifts over the total number of identi ed transitions. The question mark appears where no transitions
were identi ed.
