Abstract
We present a formalization of dependency
labeling with Integer Linear Programming.
We focus on the integration of subcategorization into the decision making process,
where the various subcategorization frames
of a verb compete with each other. A maximum entropy model provides the weights for
ILP optimization.
1 Introduction
Machine learning classifiers are widely used, although they lack one crucial model property: they
can't adhere to prescriptive knowledge. Take grammatical role (GR) labeling, which is a kind of (shallow) dependency labeling, as an example: chunkverb-pairs are classified according to a GR (cf.
(Buchholz, 1999)). The trials are independent of
each other, thus, local decisions are taken such that
e.g. a unique GR of a verb might (erroneously) get
multiply instantiated etc. Moreover, if there are alternative subcategorization frames of a verb, they
must not be confused by mixing up GR from different frames to a non-existent one. Often, a subsequent filter is used to repair such inconsistent solutions. But usually there are alternative solutions, so
the demand for an optimal repair arises.
We apply the optimization method Integer Linear
Programming (ILP) to (shallow) dependency labeling in order to generate a globally optimized consistent dependency labeling for a given sentence.
A maximum entropy classifier, trained on vectors
with morphological, syntactic and positional information automatically derived from the TIGER treebank (German), supplies probability vectors that are
used as weights in the optimization process. Thus,
the probabilities of the classifier do not any longer
provide (as usually) the solution (i.e. by picking out
the most probable candidate), but count as probabilistic suggestions to a - globally consistent - solution. More formally, the dependency labeling problem is: given a sentence with (i) verbs,
 �� , (ii) NP
and PP chunks1, ��� , label all pairs (
 ���� ���
  ��� ��� ) with a dependency relation (including a
class for the null assignment) such that all chunks
get attached and for each verb exactly one subcategorization frame is instantiated.
2 Integer Linear Programming
Integer Linear Programming is the name of a class
of constraint satisfaction algorithms which are restricted to a numerical representation of the problem
to be solved. The objective is to optimize (e.g. maximize) a linear equation called the objective function

stand in one of eight dependency relations, including a pseudo relation representing the null class.
We consider the most important dependency labels:
subject (a ), direct object (b ), indirect object (c ),
clausal complement (� ), prepositional complement
(d ), attributive (NP or PP) attachment (
$
) and adjunct (
5
). Although coarse-grained, this set allows
us to capture all functional dependencies and to construct a dependency tree for every sentence in the
corpus2. Technically, indicator variables are used
to represent attachment decisions. Together with a
weight, they form the addend of the objective function. In the case of attributive modifiers or adjuncts
(the non-governable labels), the indicator variables
correspond to triples. There are two labels of this
type:
$
F � represents that chunk e modifies chunk
` and
5
F � represents that chunk e is in an adjunct
relation to chunk ` .
 
and
&
are defined as the
weighted sum of such pairs (cf. Eq. 1 and Eq 2.
from Fig. 2), the weights (e.g.
0  !
) stem from the
statistical model.
For subcategorized labels, we have quadruples,
consisting of a label name i , a frame index $ ,
a verb p and a chunk h (also verb chunks are allowed as a h ): i qtsXu . We define
  to be the
weighted sum of all label instantiations of all verbs
(and their subcat frames), see Eq. 3 in Fig. 2.
The subscript f s is a list of pairs, where each
2
Note that we are not interested in dependencies beyond the
(base) chunk level
pair consists of a label and a subcat frame index.
This way, f s represents all subcat frames of a
verb p . For example, f of "to believe" could be:
gih
a
0
bqp
0qh
b
0
bqp
0qh
a
0sr
p
0qh
�
0tr
p
0uh
a
0tv
p
0uh
c
0sv
ptw . There
are three frames, the first one requires a a and a b .
Consider the sentence "He believes these stories".
We have xy =
g
believesw and   =
g
He, believes,
storiesw . Assume f
(
to be the f of "to believe" as
defined above. Then, e.g.  H (
7 b represents the
assignment of "stories" as the filler of the subject
relation  of the second subcat frame of "believes".
To get a dependency tree, every chunk must find
a head (chunk), except the root verb. We define a
root verb e as a verb that stands in the relation
W F �
to all other verbs ` .
W
(cf. Eq.4 from Fig.2) is the
weighted sum of all null assignment decisions. It is
part of the maximization task and thus has an impact
(a weight). The objective function is defined as the
sum of equations 1 to 4 (Eq.5 from Fig.2).
So far, our formalization was devoted to the maximization task, i.e. which chunks are in a dependency
relation, what is the label and what is the impact.
Without any further (co-occurrence) restrictions, every pair of chunks would get related with every label. In order to assure a valid linguistic model, constraints have to be formulated.
4 Basic Global Constraints
Every chunk e from  (7  ) must find a head,
that is, be bound either as an attribute, adjunct or a
verb complement. This requires all indicator variables with e as the dependent (second index) to sum
up to exactly 1.

Another (complementary) constraint is that a dependency label i of a verb must have at most one filler.
We first introduce a indicator variable i qts :

irqtsXu (9)
In order to serve as an indicator of whether a label
i (of a frame $ of a verb p ) is active or inactive, we
restrict i qts to be at most 1:

To illustrate this by the example previously given:
the subject of the second verb frame of "to believe"
is defined as  H (
7 a H (4( A
a H (
(with  H (
S
b ).
Either a H (4(
7 b or a H (
7 b or both are zero, but if
one of them is set to one, then  H (
= 1. Moreover,
as we show in the next section, the selection of the
label indicator variable of a frame enforces the frame
to be selected as well3.
5 Subcategorization as a Global Constraint
The problem with the selection among multiple subcat frames is to guarantee a valid distribution of
chunks to verb frames. We don't want to have chunk
h
(
be labeled according to verb frame $
(
and chunk
h H according to verb frame $ H . Any valid attachment
must be coherent (address one verb frame) and complete (select all of its labels).
We introduce an indicator variable � qts with frame
and verb indices. Since exactly one frame of a verb
has to be active at the end, we restrict:
��� P
�
q 
(
� qtsr7 b
0 
pg# y p
S

x y

(11)
(�� s is the number of subcat frames of verb p )
However, we would like to couple a verb's (p )
frame ($ ) to the frame's label set and restrict it to
be active (i.e. set to one) only if all of its labels
are active. To achieve this, we require equivalence,
3
There are more constraints, e.g. that no two chunks can be
attached to each other symmetrically (being chunk and modifier
of each other at the same time). We won't introduce them here.
namely that selecting any label of a frame is equivalent to selecting the frame. As defined in equation
10, a label is active, if the label indicator variable
(irqts ) is set to one. Equivalence is represented by
identity, we thus get (cf. constraint 12):
� qtsr7 irqts

$8p� f s (12)
If any i qts is set to one (zero), then � q1s is set to one
(zero) and all other ixq1s of the same subcat frame
are forced to be one (completeness). Constraint 11
ensures that exactly one subcat frame � qts can be active (coherence).
6 Maximum Entropy and ILP Weights
A maximum entropy approach was used to induce
a probability model that serves as the basis for the
ILP weights. The model was trained on the TIGER
treebank (Brants et al., 2002) with feature vectors
stemming from the following set of features: the
part of speech tags of the two candidate chunks, the
distance between them in chunks, the number of intervening verbs, the number of intervening punctuation marks, person, case and number features, the
chunks, the direction of the dependency relation (left
or right) and a passive/active voice flag.
The output of the maxent model is for each pair of
chunks a probability vector, where each entry represents the probability that the two chunks are related
by a particular label (a
0
b

including
W
).
7 Empirical Results
A 80% training set (32,000 sentences) resulted in
about 700,000 vectors, each vector representing either a proper dependency labeling of two chunks, or
a null class pairing. The accuracy of the maximum
entropy classifier was 87.46%. Since candidate pairs
are generated with only a few restrictions, most pairings are null class labelings. They form the majority
class and thus get a strong bias. If we evaluate the
dependency labels, therefore, the results drop appreciably. The maxent precision then is 62.73% (recall
is 85.76%, f-measure is 72.46 %).
Our first experiment was devoted to find out how
good our ILP approach was given that the correct
subcat frame was pre-selected by an oracle. Only
the decision which pairs are labeled with which dependency label was left to ILP (also the selection
and assignment of the non subcategorized labels).
203
There are 8000 sentence with 36,509 labels in the
test set; ILP retrieved 37,173; 31,680 were correct.
Overall precision is 85.23%, recall is 86.77%, the
f-measure is 85.99% (F ������ in Fig. 3).

Figure 3: Pre-selected versus Competing Frames
The results of the governable labels (a down to
� ) are good, except PP complements (d ) with a fmeasure of 76.4%. The errors made with � ������ : the
wrong chunks are deemed to stand in a dependency
relation or the wrong label (e.g. a instead of b )
was chosen for an otherwise valid pair. This is not a
problem of ILP, but one of the statistical model - the
weights do not discriminate well. Improvements of
the statistical model will push ILP's precision.
Clearly, performance drops if we remove the subcat frame oracle letting all subcat frames of a verb
compete with each other (Fu��   , Fig.3). How close
can Fu����   come to the oracle setting F ����� . The
overall precision of the Fu����   setting is 81.8%, recall is 85.8% and the f-measure is 83.7% (f-measure
of F ������ was 85.9%). This is not too far away.
We have also evaluated how good our model is at
finding the correct subcat frame (as a whole). First
some statistics: In the test set are 23 different subcat frames (types) with 16,137 occurrences (token).
15,239 out of these are cases where the underlying
verb has more than one subcat frame (only here do
we have a selection problem). The precision was
71.5%, i.e. the correct subcat frame was selected in
10,896 out of 15,239 cases.
8 Related Work
ILP has been applied to various NLP problems including semantic role labeling (Punyakanok et al.,
2004), which is similar to dependency labeling: both
can benefit from verb specific information. Actually,
(Punyakanok et al., 2004) take into account to some
extent verb specific information. They disallow argument types a verb does not "subcategorize for" by
setting an occurrence constraint. However, they do
not impose co-occurrence restrictions as we do (allowing for competing subcat frames).
None of the approaches to grammatical role labeling tries to scale up to dependency labeling. Moreover, they suffer from the problem of inconsistent
classifier output (e.g. (Buchholz, 1999)). A comparison of the empirical results is difficult, since e.g.
the number and type of grammatical/dependency relations differ (the same is true wrt. German dependency parsers, e.g (Foth et al., 2005)). However, our
model seeks to integrate the (probabilistic) output of
such systems and - in the best case - boosts the results, or at least turn it into a consistent solution.
9 Conclusion and Future Work
We have introduced a model for shallow dependency labeling where data-driven and theory-driven
aspects are combined in a principled way. A classifier provides empirically justified weights, linguistic theory contributes well-motivated global restrictions, both are combined under the regiment of optimization. The empirical results of our approach are
promising. However, we have made idealized assumptions (small inventory of dependency relations
and treebank derived chunks) that clearly must be
replaced by a realistic setting in our future work.
