Abstract
This paper proposes a principled approach
for analysis of semantic relations between
constituents in compound nouns based on
lexical semantic structure. One of the
difficulties of compound noun analysis is
that the mechanisms governing the decision system of semantic relations and the
representation method of semantic relations associated with lexical and contextual meaning are not obvious. The aim of
our research is to clarify how lexical semantics contribute to the relations in compound nouns since such nouns are very
productive and are supposed to be governed by systematic mechanisms. The
results of applying our approach to the
analysis of noun-deverbal compounds in
Japanese and English show that lexical
conceptual structure contributes to the restrictional rules in compounds.
1 Introduction
The difficulty of compound noun analysis is that the
effective way of describing the semantic relations
in compounds has not been identified. The description should not remain just a kind of categorization.
Rather, it should take into account the construction
of the analysis model.
The previous work proposed semantic approaches
based on semantic categories (Levi, 1978; Isabelle,
1984; Iida et al., 1984) had proposed detailed analysis of relations between constituents in compound
nouns. Some of approaches (Fabre, 1996; Johnston and Busa, 1998) take the framework of Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky, 1995). Semantic approaches are especially well designed but
they should still clarify the complete lexical factors
needed for analysis model.
Probabilistic approaches (Lauer, 1995; Lapata,
2002) have been proposed to disambiguate semantic
relations between constituents in compounds. Their
experimental results show a high performance, but
only for shallow analysis of compounds using semantically tagged corpora. To be fully effective,
they also need to incorporate factors that are effective in disambiguating semantic relations. It is therefore necessary to clarify what kinds of factors are related to the mechanisms that govern the relations in
compounds.
Against this background, we have carried out a research which aims at clarifying how lexical semantics contribute to, independently of languages, the
relations in compound nouns. This paper proposes
a principled approach for the analysis of semantic
relations between constituents in compound nouns
based on the theoretical framework of lexical conceptual structure (LCS), and shows that the framework originally developed on the basis of Japanese
compound noun data works well for both Japanese
and English compound nouns.
2 The Basic Framework
2.1 The Relation between Modifier and
Deverbal Head
The relation between constituents in deverbal compounds1
can first be divided into two: (i) the modifier becomes an internal argument (Grimshaw, 1990)
and (ii) the modifier functions as an adjunct. We as1
In the case of English the equivalent is nominalizations, but
for simplicity we use deverbal compounds.
sume these two kinds of relations are the target of
our analysis model because argument/adjunct relations are basic but extensible to more detailed semantic relations by assuming more complex semantic system. Besides these relations related to argument structure of verbs are the boundary between
syntax and semantics, then our approach must be extendable to be incorporated into sytactic analysis.
2.2 LCS-based Disambiguation Model
We assume that the discrimination between argument and adjunct relations can be done by the combination of the LCS (we call TLCS) on the side of
deverbal heads and the consistent categorization of
modifier nouns on the basis of their behavior vis-`
avis a few canonical TLCS types of deverbal heads.
Figure 1 shows examples of disambiguating relations using TLCS for the deverbal heads `sousa'
(operate) and `hon'yaku' (translate). In TLCSes, the
words written in capital letters are semantics predicates, `x' denotes the external argument, and `y' and
`z' denote the internal arguments (see Section 3).
Figure 1: Disambiguation of relations between noun
and deverbal head
The approach we propose consists of three elements: categorization of deverbals and nominalizations, categorization of modifier noun and restriction
rules for identifying relations.
3 TLCS
The framework of LCS (Hale and Keyser, 1990;
Rappaport and Levin, 1988; Jackendoff, 1990;
Kageyama, 1996) has shown that semantic decomposition based on the LCS framework can systematically explain the word formation as well as the
syntax structure. However existing LCS frameworks
cannot be applied to the analysis of compounds
straightforwardly because they do not give extensive
semantic predicates for LCS. Therefore we construct
an original LCS, called TLCS, based on the LCS
framework with a clear set of LCS types and basic
predicates. We use the acronym "TLCS" to avoid
the confusion with other LCS-based schemes.
Table 1 shows the current complete set of TLCSes types we elaborated.2
The following list is for
Japanese deverbals, but the same LCS types are applied for nominalizations in English.3
Table 1: List of TLCS types
1 [x ACT ON y]
enzan (calculate), sousa (operate)
2 [x CONTROL[BECOME [y BE AT z]]]
kioku (memorize), hon'yaku (translate)
3 [x CONTROL[BECOME [y NOT BE AT z]]]
shahei (shield), yokushi (deter)
4 [x CONTROL [y MOVE TO z]]
densou (transmit), dempan (propagate)
5 [x=y CONTROL[BECOME [y BE AT z]]]
kaifuku (recover), shuuryou (close)
6 [BECOME[y BE AT z]]
houwa (become saturated)
bumpu (be distributed)
7 [y MOVE TO z]
idou (move), sen'i (transmit)
8 [x CONTROL[y BE AT z]]
iji (maintain), hogo (protect)
9 [x CONTROL[BECOME[x BE WITH y]]]
ninshiki (recognize), yosoku (predict)
10 [y BE AT z]
sonzai (exist), ichi (locate)
11 [x ACT]
kaigi (hold a meeting), gyouretsu (queue)
12 [x CONTROL[BECOME [ [FILLED]y BE AT z]]]
shomei (sign-name)
The number attached to each TLCS type in Table
1 will be used throughout the paper refer to specific
TLCS types. In Table 1, the capital letters (such as
`ACT' and `BE') are semantic predicates, which are
11 types. `x' denotes an external argument and `y'
and `z' denote an internal argument (see (Grimshaw,
1990)). 4
2
Basicaly these 12 types are set by the combination of argument structure and aspect analysis that is telic or atelic. After
applying all the combination, we arrange the TLCS patterns by
deleting patterns that does not appear and subcategorizing certain patterns.
3
At the moment, there are about 500 deverbals in Japanese
and 40 nominalizations in English.
4
In this paper, we limit the types of arguments are three, i.e.
x (Agent), y (Theme) and z (Goal).
4 Categorization of Modifier Noun
4.1 Categorization by the Accusativity of
Modifiers
In Japanese compounds, some of modifiers can not
take an accusative case. This is an adjectival stem
and it does not appear with inflections. Therefore,
the modifier is always the adjunct in the compounds.
So we introduce the distinction of `-ACC' (unaccusative) and `+ACC' (accusative).
ACC `kimitsu' (secrecy) and `kioku' (memory) are
`+ACC', and `sougo' (mutual-ity) and `kinou'
(inductiv-e/ity) are `-ACC'. In English, they
correspond to adjective modifier such as `-ent'
of `recurrent' or `-al' of `serial'.
4.2 Categorization by the Basic Components of
TLCS
If, as argued by some theoretical linguists, the LCS
representation can contribute to explaining these
phenomena related to the arguments and aspect
structure consistently, and if the combination of LCS
and noun categorization can explain properly these
phenomena related to argumet/adjunct, then there
should be a level of consistent noun categorization
which matches the LCS on the side of deverbals. We
used the predicates of some TLCS types to explore
the noun categorizations.
In the preliminary examination, we have found
that some TLCS types can be formed into the groups
that correspond to modifier categories in Table 2.
Below are examples of modifier nouns categorized as negative or positive in terms of each of these
TLCS groups.
ON `koshou' (fault) and `seinou' (performance)
are `+ON', and `heikou' (parallel) and `rensa'
(chain) are `-ON'. (`ON' stands for the predicate in `ACT ON'.)
EC `imi' (semantic) and `kairo' (circuit) are `+EC',
and `kikai' (machine) and `densou' (transmission) are `-EC'. (`EC' stands for an External
argument Controls an internal argument'.)
AL `fuka' (load) and `jisoku' (flux) are `+AL', and
`kakusan' (diffusion) and `senkei' (linearly) are
`-AL'. (`AL' stands for alternation verbs.)
UA `jiki' (magnetic) and `joutai' (state) are `+UA',
and `junjo' (order) and `heikou' (parallel) are
`-UA'. (`UA' stands for UnAccusative verbs.)
5 Procedure of Compound Noun Analysis
The noun categories introduced in Section 4 can
be used for disambiguating the intra-term relations
in deverbal compounds with various deverbal heads
that take different TLCS types. The range of application of the noun categorizations with respect to
TLCS groups is summarized in Table 2. The number in the TLCS column corresponds to the number
given in Table 1.
Step 1 If the modifier has the category `-ACC', then
declare the relation as adjunct and terminate. If
not, go to next.
Step 2 If the TLCS of the deverbal head is 10, 11,
or 12 in Table 1, then declare the relation as
adjunct and terminate. If not, go to next.
Step 3 The analyzer determines the relation from
the interaction of lexical meanings between a
deverbal head and a modifier noun. In the case
of `-ON', `-EC',`-AL' or `-UA', declare the relation as adjunct and terminate. If not, go to
next.
Step 4 Declare the relation as internal argument and
terminate.
With these rules and categories of nouns, we
can analyze the relations between words in compounds with deverbal heads. For example, when
the modifier `kikai' (machine) is categorized as
`-EC' but `+ON', the modifier in kikai-hon'yaku
(machine-translation) is analyzed as adjunct (that
means `translation by a machine'), and the modifier in kikai-sousa (machine-operation) is analyzed
as internal argument (that means `operation of a machine'), both correctly.
6 Experiments and Evaluations
We applied the method to 1223 two-constituent
compound nouns with deverbal heads in Japanese.
809 of them are taken from a dictionary of technical terms (Aiso, 1993), and 414 from news articles
in a newspaper. We also applied the method to 200
compound nouns of technical terms (Aiso, 1993) in
English. They are extracted randomly.
According to the manual evaluation of the experiment, 99.3% (1215/ 1223) of the results were correct in Japanese, and 97% (194/200) in English. The
performance is very high. Table 2 shows the details
of how the rules are applied to disambiguating the
relations between constituents in the deverbal compounds. These results indicate that our set of LCS
and categorization of modifiers has the enough to
disambiguate the relationships we assumed.

7 Discussion
Roughly speaking, our LCS-based approach can be
available both Japanese and English deverbal nouns.
Comparing with the results between Japanese compounds and English compounds, the factor `-ACC'
looks effective to disambiguate relations. The reason is that the most of modifiers indicate adjective function by adding suffixes in English. While
in Japanese, adjectival nouns of modifiers have no
inflecitons, then the semantic-based approach is
needed for Japanese compound noun analysis.
We found that a small number of modifier nouns
deviate from our assumptions. The most typical case
is that our analysis model fails in a word with multiple semantics. For example, `right justify' is misunderstood as internal argument relation because of
ambiguity of the word `right' which has both meanings of an adjective and a noun. We consider dealing
with them as each different words like `right adj',
`right noun' in future work.
8 Conclusion
This paper proposes a principled approach for analysis of semantic relations between constituents in
compound nouns based on lexical conceptual structure we call it TLCS. The results of experiment for
Japanese compounds and English compounds show
our approach is highly promising, also the contribution of the lexical factor to disambiguation rule.
