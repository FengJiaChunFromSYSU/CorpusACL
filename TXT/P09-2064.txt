Abstract
In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), it is reasonable to globally assign semantic roles
due to strong dependencies among arguments. Some relations between arguments
significantly characterize the structural information of argument structure. In this
paper, we concentrate on thematic hierarchy that is a rank relation restricting syntactic realization of arguments. A loglinear model is proposed to accurately
identify thematic rank between two arguments. To import structural information,
we employ re-ranking technique to incorporate thematic rank relations into local
semantic role classification results. Experimental results show that automatic prediction of thematic hierarchy can help semantic role classification.
1 Introduction
In Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), it is evident that
the arguments in one sentence are highly correlated. For example, a predicate will have no more
than one Agent in most cases. It is reasonable to
label one argument while taking into account other
arguments. More structural information of all arguments should be encoded in SRL approaches.
This paper explores structural information of
predicate-argument structure from the perspective of rank relations between arguments. Thematic hierarchy theory argues that there exists a
language independent rank of possible semantic
roles, which establishes priority among arguments
with respect to their syntactic realization (Levin
and Hovav, 2005). This construct has been widely
implicated in linguistic phenomena, such as in the
subject selection rule of Fillmore's Case Grammar
(1968): "If there is an A [=Agent], it becomes the
subject; otherwise, if there is an I [=Instrument],
it becomes the subject; otherwise, the subject is
the O [=Object, i.e., Patient/Theme]". This rule
implicitly establishes precedence relations among
semantic roles mentioned and can be simplified to:
Agent Instrument Patient/Theme
Emerging from a range of more basic semantic
properties of the ranked semantic roles, thematic
hierarchies can help to construct mapping from semantics to syntax. It is therefore an appealing option for argument structure analysis. For example,
if the the rank of argument ai is shown higher than
aj, then the assignment [ai=Patient, aj=Agent] is
illegal, since the role Agent is the highest role.
We test the hypothesis that thematic rank between arguments can be accurately detected by
using syntax clues. In this paper, the concept
"thematic rank" between two arguments ai and aj
means the relationship that ai is prior to aj or aj is
prior to ai. Assigning different labels to different
relations between ai and aj, we formulate prediction of thematic rank between two arguments as a
multi-class classification task. A log-linear model
is put forward for classification. Experiments on
CoNLL-2005 data show that this approach can
get an good performance, achieving 96.42% accuracy on gold parsing data and 95.14% accuracy
on Charniak automatic parsing data.
Most existing SRL systems divide this task into
two subtasks: Argument Identification (AI) and
Semantic Role Classification (SRC). To add structural information to a local SRL approach, we incorporate thematic hierarchy relations into local
classification results using re-ranking technique
in the SRC stage. Two re-ranking approaches,
1) hard constraint re-ranking and 2) soft constraint re-ranking, are proposed to filter out unlike global semantic role assignment. Experiments
on CoNLL-2005 data indicate that our method
can yield significant improvement over a state-ofthe-art SRC baseline, achieving 0.93% and 1.32%
253
absolute accuracy improvements on hand-crafted
and automatic parsing data.
2 Prediction of Thematic Rank
2.1 Ranking Arguments in PropBank
There are two main problems in modeling thematic hierarchy for SRL on PropBank. On the one
hand, there is no consistent meaning of the core
roles (i.e. Arg0-5/ArgA). On the other hand, there
is no consensus over hierarchies of the roles in the
thematic hierarchy. For example, the Patient occupies the second highest hierarchy in some linguistic theories but the lowest in some other theories
(Levin and Hovav, 2005).
In this paper, the proto-role theory (Dowty,
1991) is taken into account to rank PropBank arguments, partially resolving the two problems above.
There are three key points in our solution. First,
the rank of Arg0 is the highest. The Agent is almost without exception the highest role in proposed hierarchies. Though PropBank defines semantic roles on a verb by verb basis, for a particular verb, Arg0 is generally the argument exhibiting features of a prototypical Agent while Arg1
is a prototypical Patient or Theme (Palmer et al.,
2005). As being the proto-Agent, the rank of Arg0
is higher than other numbered arguments. Second,
the rank of the Arg1 is second highest or lowest.
Both hierarchy of Arg1 are tested and discussed in
section 4. Third, we do not rank other arguments.
Two sets of roles closely correspond to numbered arguments: 1) referenced arguments and 2)
continuation arguments. To adapt the relation to
help these two kinds of arguments, the equivalence
relation is divided into several sub-categories. In
summary, relations of two arguments ai and aj in
this paper include: 1) ai aj: ai is higher than
aj, 2) ai  aj: ai is lower than aj, 3) aiARaj: aj
is the referenced argument of ai, 4) aiRAaj: ai is
the referenced argument of aj, 5) aiACaj: aj is
the continuation argument of ai, 6) aiCAaj: ai is
the continuation argument of aj, 7) ai = aj: ai
and aj are labeled as the same role label, and 8)
ai  aj: ai and aj are labeled as the Arg2-5, but
not in the same type.
2.2 Prediction Method
Assigning different labels to possible rank between two arguments ai and aj, such as labeling
ai aj as " ", identification of thematic rank
can be formulated as a classification problem. Delemma, POS Tag, voice, and SCF of predicate
categories, position of two arguments; rewrite
rules expanding subroots of two arguments
content and POS tags of the boundary words
and head words
category path from the predicate to candidate
arguments
single character category path from the
predicate to candidate arguments
conjunction of categories, position, head
words, POS of head words
category and single character category path
from the first argument to the second argument
Table 1: Features for thematic rank identification.
note the set of relations R. Formally, given a score
function STH : A � A � R  R, the relation r is
recognized in argmax flavor:
^
r = r
(ai, aj) = arg max
rR
STH(ai, aj, r)
A probability function is chosen as the score function and the log-linear model is used to estimate
the probability:
STH(ai, aj, r) =
exp{(ai, aj, r) � w}
rR exp{(ai, aj, r) � w}
where  is the feature map and w is the parameter vector to learn. Note that the model predicts the rank of ai and aj through calculating
STH(ai, aj, r) rather than STH(aj, ai, r), where
ai precedes aj. In other words, the position information is implicitly encoded in the model rather
than explicitly as a feature.
The system extracts a number of features to represent various aspects of the syntactic structure of
a pair of arguments. All features are listed in Table
1. The Path features are designed as a sequential
collection of phrase tags by (Gildea and Jurafsky,
2002). We also use Single Character Category
Path, in which each phrase tag is clustered to a category defined by its first character (Pradhan et al.,
2005). To characterize the relation between two
constituents, we combine features of the two individual arguments as new features (i.e. conjunction
features). For example, if the category of the first
argument is NP and the category of the second is S,
then the conjunction of category feature is NP-S.
3 Re-ranking Models for SRC
Toutanova et al. (2008) empirically showed that
global information is important for SRL and that
254
structured solutions outperform local semantic
role classifiers. Punyakanok et al. (2008) raised an
inference procedure with integer linear programming model, which also showed promising results.
Identifying relations among arguments can provide structural information for SRL. Take the sentence "[Arg0 She] [V addressed] [Arg1 her husband] [ArgM-MNR with her favorite nickname]."
for example, if the thematic rank of she and her
husband is predicted as that she is higher than her
husband, then her husband should not be assigned
the highest role.
To incorporate the relation information to local classification results, we employ re-ranking approach. Assuming that the local semantic classifier can produce a list of labeling results, our system then attempts to pick one from this list according to the predicted ranks. Two different polices
are implemented: 1) hard constraint re-ranking,
and 2) soft constraint re-ranking.
Hard Constraint Re-ranking The one picked
up must be strictly in accordance with the ranks.
If the rank prediction result shows the rank of argument ai is higher than aj, then role assignments
such as [ai=Patient and aj=Agent] will be eliminated. Formally, the score function of a global
semantic role assignment is:
S(a, s) =
i
Sl(ai, si)
i,j,i<j
I(r
(ai, aj), r(si, sj))
where the function Sl locally scores an argument;
r : A � A  R is to predict hierarchy of two
arguments; r : S � S  R is to point out the thematic hierarchy of two semantic roles. For example, r(Agent, Patient) = " ". I : R � R 
{0, 1} is identity function.
In some cases, there is no role assignment satisfies all predicted relations because of prediction
mistakes. For example, if the hierarchy detection result of a = (a1, a2, a3) is (r(a1, a2) =
, r(a2, a3) = , r(a1, a3) =), there will be no
legal role assignment. In these cases, our system
returns local SRL results.
Soft Constraint Re-ranking In this approach,
the predicted confidence score of relations is
added as factor items to the score function of the
semantic role assignment. Formally, the score
function in soft constraint re-ranking is:
S(a, s) =
i
Sl(ai, si)
i,j,i<j
STH(ai, aj, r(si, sj))
4 Experiments
4.1 Experimental Settings
We evaluated our system using the CoNLL-2005
shared task data. Hierarchy labels for experimental corpora are automatically set according to the
definition of relation labels described in section
2.1. Charniak parser (Charniak, 2000) is used for
POS tagging and full parsing. UIUC Semantic
Role Labeler 1 is a state-of-the-art SRL system. Its
argument classification module is used as a strong
local semantic role classifier. This module is retrained in our SRC experiments, using parameters
described in (Koomen et al., 2005). Experiments
of SRC in this paper are all based on good argument boundaries which can filter out the noise
raised by argument identification stage.
4.2 Which Hierarchy Is Better?
Detection SRL (S) SRL (G)
Baseline � 94.77% �
A 94.65% 95.44% 96.89%
A & P 95.62% 95.07% 96.39%
A & P 94.09% 95.13% 97.22%
Table 2: Accuracy on different hierarchies
Table 2 summarizes the performance of thematic rank prediction and SRC on different thematic hierarchies. All experiments are tested on
development corpus. The first row shows the performance of the local sematic role classifier. The
second to the forth rows show the performance
based on three ranking approach. A means that
the rank of Agent is the highest; P means that the
rank of Patient is the second highest; P means
that the rank of the Patient is the lowest. Column SRL(S) shows SRC performance based on
soft constraint re-ranking approach, and column
SRL(G) shows SRC performance based on gold
hierarchies. The data shows that the third thematic hierarchy fits SRL best, but is harder to
learn. Compared with P, P is more suitable for
SRL. In the following SRC experiments, we use
the first hierarchy because it is most helpful when
predicted relations are used.
4.3 Results And Improvement Analysis

seen as a simple baseline. Moreover, another natural baseline system can predict hierarchies according to the roles classified by local classifier. For
example, if the ai is labeled as Arg0 and aj is labeled as Arg2, then the relation is predicted as .
The third column BL shows the F-measure of this
baseline. It is clear that our approach significantly
outperforms the two baselines.

Table 4: Overall SRC accuracy.
Hierarchy prediction and re-ranking can be
viewed as modification for local classification results with structural information. Take the sentence "[Some 'circuit breakers' installed after the
October 1987] crash failed [their first test]." for
example, where phrases "Some ... 1987" and
"their ... test" are two arguments. The table below shows the local classification result (column
Score(L)) and the rank prediction result (column
Score(H)). The baseline system falsely assigns
roles as Arg0+Arg1, the rank relation of which is
. Taking into account rank prediction result that
relation  gets a extremely high probability, our
system returns Arg1+Arg2 as SRL result.
Assignment Score(L) Score(H)
Arg0+Arg1 78.97% � 82.30% :0.02%
Arg1+Arg2 14.25% � 11.93% :99.98%
5 Conclusion and Future Work
Inspired by thematic hierarchy theory, this paper
concentrates on thematic hierarchy relation which
characterize the structural information for SRL.
The prediction of thematic rank is formulated as
a classification problem and a log-linear model
is proposed to solve this problem. To improve
SRC, we employ re-ranking technique to incorporate thematic rank information into the local semantic role classifier. Experimental results show
that our methods can construct high-performance
thematic rank detector and that identification of arguments' relations can significantly improve SRC.
