Abstract
In this paper, we present a novel global reordering model that can be incorporated
into standard phrase-based statistical machine translation. Unlike previous local
reordering models that emphasize the reordering of adjacent phrase pairs (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005), our model explicitly models the reordering of long distances by directly estimating the parameters from the phrase alignments of bilingual training sentences. In principle, the
global phrase reordering model is conditioned on the source and target phrases
that are currently being translated, and
the previously translated source and target phrases. To cope with sparseness, we
use N-best phrase alignments and bilingual phrase clustering, and investigate a
variety of combinations of conditioning
factors. Through experiments, we show,
that the global reordering model significantly improves the translation accuracy
of a standard Japanese-English translation
task.
1 Introduction
Global reordering is essential to the translation of
languages with different word orders. Ideally, a
model should allow the reordering of any distance,
because if we are to translate from Japanese to English, the verb in the Japanese sentence must be
moved from the end of the sentence to the beginning just after the subject in the English sentence.

Graduated in March 2006
Standard phrase-based translation systems use
a word distance-based reordering model in which
non-monotonic phrase alignment is penalized
based on the word distance between successively
translated source phrases without considering the
orientation of the phrase alignment or the identities of the source and target phrases (Koehn et al.,
2003; Och and Ney, 2004). (Tillmann and Zhang,
2005) introduced the notion of a block (a pair of
source and target phrases that are translations of
each other), and proposed the block orientation
bigram in which the local reordering of adjacent
blocks are expressed as a three-valued orientation, namely Right (monotone), Left (swapped),
or Neutral. A block with neutral orientation is supposed to be less strongly linked to its predecessor
block: thus in their model, the global reordering is
not explicitly modeled.
In this paper, we present a global reordering
model that explicitly models long distance reordering1. It predicts four type of reordering
patterns, namely MA (monotone adjacent), MG
(monotone gap), RA (reverse adjacent), and RG
(reverse gap). There are based on the identities of
the source and target phrases currently being translated, and the previously translated source and target phrases. The parameters of the reordering
model are estimated from the phrase alignments of
training bilingual sentences. To cope with sparseness, we use N-best phrase alignments and bilingual phrase clustering.
In the following sections, we first describe the
global phrase reordering model and its param1
It might be misleading to call our reordering model
"global" since it is at most considers two phrases. A truly
global reordering model would take the entire sentence structure into account.

eter estimation method including N-best phrase
alignments and bilingual phrase clustering. Next,
through an experiment, we show that the global
phrase reordering model significantly improves
the translation accuracy of the IWSLT-2005
Japanese-English translation task (Eck and Hori,
2005).
2 Baseline Translation Model
In statistical machine translation, the translation of
a source (foreign) sentence
 
is formulated as the
search for a target (English) sentence �� that maximizes the conditional probability ��� ���  ��
, which
can be rewritten using the Bayes rule as,
�� "!
# ��� �$�  �� %& "!
# ���
  � � �
��� � �
where �'�
  � � �
is a translation model and �'� � �
is a
target language model.
In phrase-based statistical machine translation,
the source sentence
 
is segmented into a sequence
of ( phrases )
 102 , and each source phrase )
 "3
is translated into a target phrase )
� 3
. Target phrases may be
reordered. The translation model used in (Koehn
et al., 2003) is the product of translation probability 45� )

Figure 2: Four types of reordering patterns
3 The Global Phrase Reordering Model
Figure 1 shows an example of Japanese-English
phrase alignment that consists of four phrase pairs.
Note that the Japanese verb phrase "  " at
the the end of the sentence is aligned to the English
verb "is" at the beginning of the sentence just after
the subject. Such reordering is typical in JapaneseEnglish translations.
Motivated by the three-valued orientation for local reordering in (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005), we
define the following four types of reordering patterns, as shown in Figure 2,
 monotone adjacent (MA): The two source
phrases are adjacent, and are in the same order as the two target phrases.
 monotone gap (MG): The two source phrases
are not adjacent, but are in the same order as
the two target phrases.
 reverse adjacent (RA): The two source
phrases are adjacent, but are in the reverse order of the two target phrases.

Monotone Adjacent 0.441 0.828
Monotone Gap 0.281 0.106
Reverse Adjacent 0.206 0.033
Reverse Gap 0.072 0.033
Table 1: Percentage of reordering patterns
 reverse gap (RG): The two source phrases are
not adjacent, and are in the reverse order as
the two target phrases.
For the global reordering model, we only consider the cases in which the two target phrases
are adjacent because, in decoding, the target sentence is generated from left to right and phrase by
phrase. If we are to generate the T -th target phrase

Table 1 shows the percentage of each reordering pattern that appeared in the N-best phrase
alignments of the training bilingual sentences for
the IWSLT 2005 Japanese-English and ChineseEnglish translation tasks (Eck and Hori, 2005).
Since non-local reorderings such as monotone gap
and reverse gap are more frequent in Japanese to
English translations, they are worth modeling explicitly in this reordering model.
Since the probability of reordering pattern 6 (intended to stand for `distortion') is conditioned on
the current and previous blocks, the global phrase
reordering model is formalized as follows:

in Equation (1) with the global phrase reordering model
in Equation (4) with minimal modification of the
underlying phrase-based decoding algorithm.
4 Parameter Estimation Method
In principle, the parameters of the global phrase
reordering model in Equation (4) can be estimated
from the relative frequencies of respective events
in the Viterbi phrase alignment of the training
bilingual sentences. This straightforward estimation method, however, often suffers from sparse
data problem. To cope with this sparseness, we
used N-best phrase alignment and bilingual phrase

4.1 N-best Phrase Alignment
In order to obtain the Viterbi phrase alignment
of a bilingual sentence pair, we search for the
phrase segmentation and phrase alignment that
maximizes the product of the phrase translation

��� � 3 �   � �

where
  �

are words in the target and source
phrases.
The phrase alignment based on Equation (5) can
be thought of as an extension of word alignment
based on the IBM Model 1 to phrase alignment.
Note that bilingual phrase segmentation (phrase
extraction) is also done using the same criteria.
The approximation in Equation (6) is motivated
by (Vogel et al., 2003). Here, we added the second
term ��� � 3 �   � �
to cope with the asymmetry between
���
  � � � 3P�
and ��� � 3 �   � �
. The word translation probabilities are estimated using the GIZA++ (Och and
Ney, 2003).
The above search is implemented in the following way:
1. All source word and target word pairs are
considered to be initial phrase pairs.
715
2. If the phrase translation probability of the
phrase pair is less than the threshold, it is
deleted.
3. Each phrase pair is expanded toward the eight
neighboring directions as shown in Figure 3.
4. If the phrase translation probability of the expanded phrase pair is less than the threshold,
it is deleted.
5. The process of expansion and deletion is repeated until no further expansion is possible.
6. The consistent N-best phrase alignment are
searched from all combinations of the above
phrase pairs.
The search for consistent Viterbi phrase alignments can be implemented as a phrase-based decoder using a beam search whose outputs are constrained only to the target sentence. The consistent
N-best phrase alignment can be obtained by using
A* search as described in (Ueffing et al., 2002).
We did not use any reordering constraints, such as
IBM constraint and ITG constraint in the search
for the N-best phrase alignment (Zens et al., 2004).
The thresholds used in the search are the following: the minimum phrase translation probability is 0.0001. The maximum number of translation
candidates for each phrase is 20. The beam width
is 1e-10, the stack size (for each target candidate
word length) is 1000. We found that, compared
with the decoding of sentence translation, we have
to search significantly larger space for the N-best
phrase alignment.
Figure 3 shows an example of phrase pair
expansion toward eight neighbors. If the current phrase pair is (  , of), the expanded phrase
pairs are (���������   , means of), (  ,
means of), (    , means of), (�!���"� � 
�   , of), (   , of), (�#�$�%� �& '�
  , of communication), (  , of communication),
and (  ( , of communication).
Figure 4 shows an example of the best three
phrase alignments for a Japanese-English bilingual sentence. For the estimation of the global
phrase reordering model, preliminary tests have
shown that the appropriate N-best number is 20.
In counting the events for the relative frequency
estimation, we treat all N-best phrase alignments
equally.
For comparison, we also implemented a different N-best phrase alignment method, where

Figure 4: N-best phrase alignments
phrase pairs are extracted using the standard
phrase extraction method described in (Koehn et
al., 2003). We call this conventional phrase extraction method "grow-diag-final", and the proposed phrase extraction method "ppicker" (this is
intended to stand for phrase picker).
4.2 Bilingual Phrase Clustering
The second approach to cope with the sparseness
in Equation (4) is to group the phrases into equivalence classes. We used a bilingual word clustering tool, mkcls (Och et al., 1999) for this purpose.
It forms partitions of the vocabulary of the two
languages to maximize the joint probability of the
training bilingual corpus.
In order to perform bilingual phrase clustering,
all words in a phrase are concatenated by an underscore ' ' to form a pseudo word. We then use the
modified bilingual sentences as the input to mkcls. We treat all N-best phrase alignments equally.
Thus, the phrase alignments in Figure 4 are converted to the following three bilingual sentence
pairs.
)#0
_1 _2 _43 _5
the_light_was_red
)#0
_1 2 _43 _5
the_light was_red
)#0
_1 2 63 _5
the_light was red
Preliminary tests have shown that the appropriate
number of classes for the estimation of the global
phrase reordering model is 20.
As a comparison, we also tried two phrase classification methods based on the part of speech of
the head word (Ohashi et al., 2005). We defined
(arguably) the first word of each English phrase
and the last word of each Japanese phrase as the

Table 2: All reordering models tried in the experiments
head word. We then used the part of speech of
the head word as the phrase class. We call this
method "1pos". Since we are not sure whether it is
appropriate to introduce asymmetry in head word
selection, we also tried a "2pos" method, where
the parts of speech of both the first and the last
words are used for phrase classification.
4.3 Conditioning Factor of Reordering
The third approach to cope with sparseness in
Equation (4) is to approximate the equation by reducing the conditioning factors.
Other than the baseline word distance-based
reordering model and the Equation (4) itself,
we tried eight different approximations of Equation (4) as shown in Table 2, where, the symbol in
the left column is the shorthand for the reordering
model in the right column.
The approximations are designed based on two
intuitions. The current block ()

probably be more important than the previous
block ()

 "3SE 2 ). The previous target phrase

target phrase ()
� 3
) because the distortion model of
IBM 4 is conditioned on )
� 3SE 2 , )
 "3SE 2 and )

. The
appropriate form of the global phrase reordering
model is decided through experimentation.
5 Experiments
5.1 Corpus and Tools
We used the IWSLT-2005 Japanese-English translation task (Eck and Hori, 2005) for evaluating the
proposed global phrase reordering model. We report results using the well-known automatic evaluation metrics Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002).
IWSLT (International Workshop on Spoken
Sentences Words Vocabulary

English 20,000 183,452 6,956
Table 3: IWSLT 2005 Japanese-English training
data
Language Translation) 2005 is an evaluation campaign for spoken language translation.Its task
domain encompasses basic travel conversations.
20,000 bilingual sentences are provided for training. Table 3 shows the number of words and the
size of vocabulary of the training data. The average sentence length of Japanese is 9.9 words,
while that of English is 9.2 words.
Two development sets, each containing 500
source sentences, are also provided and each
development sentence comes with 16 reference
translations. We used the second development set
(devset2) for the experiments described in this paper. This 20,000 sentence corpus allows for fast
experimentation and enables us to study different
aspects of the proposed global phrase reordering
model.
Japanese word segmentation was done using
ChaSen2 and English tokenization was done using
a tool provided by LDC3. For the phrase classification based on the parts of speech of the head
word, we used the first two layers of the Chasen's
part of speech tag for Japanese. For English part
of speech tagging, we used MXPOST4.
Word translation probabilities are obtained by
using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003). For training,
all English words are made in lower case. We used
a back-off word trigram model as the language
model. It is trained from the lowercased English
side of the training corpus using a statistical language modeling toolkit, Palmkit 5.
We implemented our own decoder based on the
algorithm described in (Ueffing et al., 2002). For
decoding, we used phrase translation probability,
lexical translation probability, word penalty, and
distortion (phrase reordering) probability. Minimum error rate training was not used for weight
optimization.
The thresholds used in the decoding are the following: the minimum phrase translation probability is 0.01. The maximum number of translation

Table 4: BLEU score of reordering models with
different phrase extraction methods
candidates for each phrase is 10. The beam width
is 1e-5, the stack size (for each target candidate
word length) is 100.
5.2 Clustered and Lexicalized Model
Figure 5 shows the BLEU score of clustered and
lexical reordering model with different conditioning factors. Here, "class" shows the accuracy
when the identity of each phrase is represented by
its class, which is obtained by the bilingual phrase
clustering, while "lex" shows the accuracy when
the identity of each phrases is represented by its
lexical form.
The clustered reordering model "class" is generally better than the lexicalized reordering model
"lex". The accuracy of "lex" drops rapidly as the
number of conditioning factors increases. The reordering models using the part of speech of the
head word for phrase classification such as "1pos"
and "2pos" are somewhere in between.
The best score is achieved by the clustered
model when the phrase reordering pattern is conditioned on either the current target phrase )
� 3
or
the current block, namely phrase pair )
� 3
and )
  3
.
They are significantly better than the baseline of
the word distance-based reordering model.
5.3 Interaction between Phrase Extraction
and Phrase Alignment
Table 4 shows the BLEU score of reordering models with different phrase extraction methods. Here,
"ppicker" shows the accuracy when phrases are
extracted by using the N-best phrase alignment
method described in Section 4.1, while "growdiag-final" shows the accuracy when phrases are
extracted using the standard phrase extraction algorithm described in (Koehn et al., 2003).
It is obvious that, for building the global phrase
reordering model, our phrase extraction method is
significantly better than the conventional phrase
extraction method. We assume this is because the
proposed N-best phrase alignment method optimizes the combination of phrase extraction (segmentation) and phrase alignment in a sentence.
5.4 Global and Local Reordering Model
In order to show the advantages of explicitly modeling global phrase reordering, we implemented a
different reordering model where the reordering
pattern is classified into three values: monotone
adjacent, reverse adjacent and neutral. By collapsing monotone gap and reverse gap into neutral, it
can be thought of as a local reordering model similar to the block orientation bigram (Tillmann and
Zhang, 2005).
Figure 6 shows the BLEU score of the local
and global reordering models. Here, "class3"
and "lex3"represent the three-valued local reordering model, while "class4" and "lex4"represent the
four-valued global reordering model. "Class" and
"lex" represent clustered and lexical models, respectively. We used "grow-diag-final" for phrase
extraction in this experiment.
It is obvious that the four-valued global reordering model consistently outperformed the threevalued local reordering model under various conditioning factors.
6 Discussion
As shown in Figure 5, the reordering model of
Equation (4) (indicated as e[-1,0]f[-1,0] in shorthand) suffers from a sparse data problem even if
phrase clustering is used. The empirically justifiable global reordering model seems to be the following, conditioned on the classes of source and
target phrases:
�'�96 �
W�  8����$� )
� 3P�De
W�  8������ )
 "3 � �
(7)
which is similar to the block orientation bigram
(Tillmann and Zhang, 2005). We should note,
however, that the block orientation bigram is a
joint probability model for the sequence of blocks
(source and target phrases) as well as their orientations (reordering pattern) whose purpose is very
different from our global phrase reordering model.
The advantage of the reordering model is that it
can better model global phrase reordering using a
four-valued reordering pattern, and it can be easily

The problem of the global phrase reordering
model is the cost of parameter estimation. In
particular, the N-best phrase alignment described
in Section 4.1 is computationally expensive. We
must devise a more efficient phrase alignment algorithm that can globally optimize both phrase
segmentation (phrase extraction) and phrase alignment.
7 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a novel global phrase
reordering model, that is estimated from the Nbest phrase alignment of training bilingual sentences. Through experiments, we were able to
show that our reordering model offers improved
translation accuracy over the baseline method.
