Abstract
Supervised learning methods for WSD yield better
performance than unsupervised methods. Yet the
availability of clean training data for the former is
still a severe challenge. In this paper, we present
an unsupervised bootstrapping approach for WSD
which exploits huge amounts of automatically generated noisy data for training within a supervised
learning framework. The method is evaluated using
the 29 nouns in the English Lexical Sample task of
SENSEVAL2. Our algorithm does as well as supervised algorithms on 31% of this test set, which is an
improvement of 11% (absolute) over state-of-the-art
bootstrapping WSD algorithms. We identify seven
different factors that impact the performance of our
system.
1 Introduction
Supervised Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD)
systems perform better than unsupervised systems.
But lack of training data is a severe bottleneck
for supervised systems due to the extensive labor and cost involved. Indeed, one of the main
goals of the SENSEVAL exercises is to create large
amounts of sense-annotated data for supervised systems (Kilgarriff&Rosenzweig, 2000). The problem
is even more challenging for languages which possess scarce computer readable knowledge resources.
In this paper, we investigate the role of large
amounts of noisily sense annotated data obtained
using an unsupervised approach in relieving the data
acquisition bottleneck for the WSD task. We bootstrap a supervised learning WSD system with an unsupervised seed set. We use the sense annotated data
produced by Diab's unsupervised system SALAAM
(Diab&Resnik, 2002; Diab, 2003). SALAAM is a
WSD system that exploits parallel corpora for sense
disambiguation of words in running text. To date,
SALAAM yields the best scores for an unsupervised
system on the SENSEVAL2 English All-Words task
(Diab, 2003). SALAAM is an appealing approach
as it provides automatically sense annotated data in
two languages simultaneously, thereby providing a
multilingual framework for solving the data acquisition problem. For instance, SALAAM has been used
to bootstrap the WSD process for Arabic as illustrated in (Diab, 2004).
In a supervised learning setting, WSD is cast as
a classification problem, where a predefined set of
sense tags constitutes the classes. The ambiguous words in text are assigned one or more of
these classes by a machine learning algorithm based
on some extracted features. This algorithm learns
parameters from explicit associations between the
class and the features, or combination of features,
that characterize it. Therefore, such systems are
very sensitive to the training data, and those data
are, generally, assumed to be as clean as possible.
In this paper, we question that assumption. Can
large amounts of noisily annotated data used in
training be useful within such a learning paradigm
for WSD? What is the nature of the quality-quantity
trade-off in addressing this problem?
2 Related Work
To our knowledge, the earliest study of bootstrapping a WSD system with noisy data is by Gale et.
al., (Gale et al. , 1992). Their investigation was limited in scale to six data items with two senses each
and a bounded number of examples per test item.
Two more recent investigations are by Yarowsky,
(Yarowsky, 1995), and later, Mihalcea, (Mihalcea,
2002). Each of the studies, in turn, addresses the issue of data quantity while maintaining good quality
training examples. Both investigations present algorithms for bootstrapping supervised WSD systems
using clean data based on a dictionary or an ontological resource. The general idea is to start with
a clean initial seed and iteratively increase the seed
size to cover more data.
Yarowsky starts with a few tagged instances to
train a decision list approach. The initial seed is
manually tagged with the correct senses based on
entries in Roget's Thesaurus. The approach
yields very successful results -- 95% -- on a handful of data items.
Mihalcea, on the other hand, bases the bootstrapping approach on a generation algorithm, GenCor
(Mihalcea&Moldovan, 1999). GenCor creates
seeds from monosemous words in WordNet, Semcor data, sense tagged examples from the glosses
of polysemous words in WordNet, and other hand
tagged data if available. This initial seed set is used
for querying the Web for more examples and the retrieved contexts are added to the seed corpus. The
words in the contexts of the seed words retrieved are
then disambiguated. The disambiguated contexts
are then used for querying the Web for yet more
examples, and so on. It is an iterative algorithm
that incrementally generates large amounts of sense
tagged data. The words found are restricted to either
part of noun compounds or internal arguments of
verbs. Mihalcea's supervised learning system is an
instance-based-learning algorithm. In the study, Mihalcea compares results yielded by the supervised
learning system trained on the automatically generated data, GenCor, against the same system trained
on manually annotated data. She reports successful
results on six of the data items tested.
3 Empirical Layout
Similar to Mihalcea's approach, we compare results
obtained by a supervised WSD system for English
using manually sense annotated training examples
against results obtained by the same WSD system
trained on SALAAM sense tagged examples. The
test data is the same, namely, the SENSEVAL 2
English Lexical Sample test set. The supervised
WSD system chosen here is the University of Maryland System for SENSEVAL 2 Tagging (

(Cabezas et al. , 2002).
3.1
 �������
The learning approach adopted by
 ������
is based on Support Vector Machines
(SVM).
 ������� uses SVM- "!$# by Joachims
(Joachims, 1998).1
For each target word, where a target word is a
test item, a family of classifiers is constructed, one
for each of the target word senses. All the positive
examples for a sense % �'&( are considered the negative examples of % �0)1( , where 32465 .(Allwein et al.,
2000) In
 ������� , each target word is considered
an independent classification problem.
The features used for
 ������ are mainly contextual features with weight values associated with
each feature. The features are space delimited units,
1
http://www.ai.cs.uni.dortmund.de/svmlight.
tokens, extracted from the immediate context of the
target word. Three types of features are extracted:
7 Wide Context Features: All the tokens in the
paragraph where the target word occurs.
7 Narrow Context features: The tokens that collocate in the surrounding context, to the left
and right, with the target word within a fixed
window size of 8 .
7 Grammatical Features: Syntactic tuples such
as verb-obj, subj-verb, etc. extracted from the
context of the target word using a dependency
parser, MINIPAR (Lin, 1998).
Each feature extracted is associated with a weight
value. The weight calculation is a variant on the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) measure in Information Retrieval. The weighting, in this case, is an
Inverse Category Frequency (ICF) measure where
each token is weighted by the inverse of its frequency of occurrence in the specified context of the
target word.
3.1.1 Manually Annotated Training Data
The manually-annotated training data is the SENSEVAL2 Lexical Sample training data for the English task, (SV2LS Train).2 This training data corpus comprises 44856 lines and 917740 tokens.
There is a close affinity between the test data and
the manually annotated training data. The Pearson
%@9 ( correlation between the sense distributions for
the test data and the manually annotated training
data, per test item, ranges between ACBEDGFIH .3
3.2 SALAAM
SALAAM exploits parallel corpora for sense annotation. The key intuition behind SALAAM is that when
words in one language, L1, are translated into the
same word in a second language, L2, then those
L1 words are semantically similar. For example,
when the English -- L1 -- words bank, brokerage,
mortgage-lender translate into the French -- L2 -word banque in a parallel corpus, where bank is polysemous, SALAAM discovers that the intended sense
for bank is the financial institution sense, not the
geological formation sense, based on the fact that
it is grouped with brokerage and mortgage-lender.
SALAAM's algorithm is as follows:
7 SALAAM expects a word aligned parallel corpus as input;
2
http://www.senseval.org
3
The correlation is measured between two frequency distributions. Throughout this paper, we opt for using the parametric
Pearson P correlation rather than KL distance in order to test
statistical significance.
7 L1 words that translate into the same L2 word
are grouped into clusters;
7 SALAAM identifies the appropriate senses for
the words in those clusters based on the words
senses' proximity in WordNet. The word sense
proximity is measured in information theoretic terms based on an algorithm by Resnik
(Resnik, 1999);
7 A sense selection criterion is applied to choose
the appropriate sense label or set of sense labels for each word in the cluster;
7 The chosen sense tags for the words in the
cluster are propagated back to their respective
contexts in the parallel text. Simultaneously,
SALAAM projects the propagated sense tags for
L1 words onto their L2 corresponding translations.
3.2.1 Automatically Generated SALAAM
Training Data
Three sets of SALAAM tagged training corpora are
created:
7 SV2LS TR: English SENSEVAL2 Lexical
Sample trial and training corpora with no manual annotations. It comprises 61879 lines and
1084064 tokens.
7 MT: The English Brown Corpus, SENSEVAL1 (trial, training and test corpora), Wall
Street Journal corpus, and SENSEVAL 2 All
Words corpus. All of which comprise 151762
lines and 37945517 tokens.
7 HT: UN English corpus which comprises
71672 lines of 1734001 tokens
The SALAAM-tagged corpora are rendered in a
format similar to that of the manually annotated
training data. The automatic sense tagging for
MT and SV2LS TR training data is based on using SALAAM with machine translated parallel corpora. The HT training corpus is automatically sense
tagged based on using SALAAM with the EnglishSpanish UN naturally occurring parallel corpus.
3.3 Experimental Conditions
Experimental conditions are created based on three
of SALAAM's tagging factors, Corpus, Language
and Threshold:
7 Corpus: There are 4 different combinations
for the training corpora: MT+SV2LS TR;
MT+HT+SV2LS TR; HT+SV2LS TR; or
SV2LS TR alone.
7 Language: The context language of the parallel corpus used by SALAAM to obtain the sense
tags for the English training corpus. There are
three options: French (FR), Spanish (SP), or,
Merged languages (ML), where the results are
obtained by merging the English output of FR
and SP.
7 Threshold: Sense selection criterion, in
SALAAM, is set to either MAX (M) or
THRESH (T).
These factors result in 39 conditions.4
3.4 Test Data
The test data are the 29 noun test items for the SENSEVAL 2 English Lexical Sample task, (SV2LSTest). The data is tagged with the WordNet 1.7pre
(Fellbaum, 1998; Cotton et al. , 2001). The average
perplexity for the test items is 3.47 (see Section 5.3),
the average number of senses is 7.93, and the total
number of contexts for all senses of all test items is
1773.

4.1 Metrics
We report the results using two metrics, the harmonic mean of precision and recall, (������� ) score,
and the Performance Ratio (PR), which we define
as the ratio between two precision scores on the
same test data where precision is rendered using
scorer2. PR is measured as follows:

Originally, there are 48 conditions, 9 of which are excluded
due to extreme sparseness in training contexts.

 ��������  
. This is an improvement of 11% absolute over state-of-the-art bootstrapping WSD algorithm yielded by Mihalcea (Mihalcea, 2002). Mihalcea reports high PR scores for
six test items only: art, chair, channel, church, detention, nation. It is worth highlighting that her
bootstrapping approach is partially supervised since
it depends mainly on hand labelled data as a seed
for the training data.
Interestingly, two nouns, detention and chair,
yield better performance than
 ��������  
, as indicated by the PRs H BA�  and H BA Q , respectively. This
is attributed to the fact that SALAAM produces a lot
more correctly annotated training data for these two
words than that provided in the manually annotated
training data for
 �������  
.
Some nouns yield very poor PR values mainly
due to the lack of training contexts, which is the case
for mouth in
 ������ � ���A�B�
, for example. Or lack
of coverage of all the senses in the test data such as
for bar and day, or simply errors in the annotation
of the SALAAM-tagged training data.
If we were to include only nouns that achieve acceptable PR scores of � ACBFE�  -- the first 16 nouns in
Table 2 for
 �������� � �D
-- the overall potential
precision of
 ������ � is significantly increased
to 63.8% and the overall precision of
 �������  
is increased to 68.4%.8
These results support the idea that we could replace hand tagging with SALAAM's unsupervised
tagging if we did so for those items that yield an acceptable PR score. But the question remains: How
do we predict which training/test items will yield
acceptable PR scores?
5 Factors Affecting Performance Ratio
In an attempt to address this question, we analyze
several different factors for their impact on the performance of
 ������� � quanitified as PR. In order to effectively alleviate the sense annotation acquisition bottleneck, it is crucial to predict which
items would be reliably annotated automatically using
 ������� � . Accordingly, in the rest of this paper, we explore 7 different factors by examining the
yielded PR values in
 �������� � �CD
.
5.1 Number of Senses
The test items that possess many senses, such as art
(17 senses), material (16 senses), mouth (10 senses)
and post (12 senses), exhibit PRs of 0.98, 0.92, 0.73
and 0.66, respectively. Overall, the correlation between number of senses per noun and its PR score
is an insignificant 9 4�� ACBE8CH , % �G% H��Q��
( 4 QBED�� P
ACB H ( . Though it is a weak negative correlation, it
does suggest that when the number of senses increases, PR tends to decrease.
5.2 Number of Training Examples
This is a characteristic of the training data. We examine the correlation between the PR and the num8

achieves an overall &�')(10 score of 2 3 in the WSD task.
ber of training examples available to
 �������� �
for each noun in the training data. The correlation
between the number of training examples and PR is
insignificant at 9 44� ACB H2  , % �G% H��Q��
( 4 ACBFE 8��5� P
ACBG
( . More interestingly, however, spade, with only
5 training examples, yields a PR score of H BA . This
contrasts with nation, which has more than 4200
training examples, but yields a low PR score of ACB6  D .
Accordingly, the number of training examples alone
does not seem to have a direct impact on PR.
5.3 Sense Perplexity
This factor is a characteristic of the training data.
Perplexity is Q�798
�A@CBD)E
. Entropy is measured as follows:
 
%GF
( 4��IH
�PRQ �%GS
(  # �T %U�%GS
( ( (2)
where S is a sense for a polysemous noun and F is
the set of all its senses.
Entropy is a measure of confusability in the
senses' contexts distributions; when the distribution
is relatively uniform, entropy is high. A skew in the
senses' contexts distributions indicates low entropy,
and accordingly, low perplexity. The lowest possible perplexity is H , corresponding to A entropy. A
low sense perplexity is desirable since it facilitates
the discrimination of senses by the learner, therefore leading to better classification. In the SALAAMtagged training data, for example, bar has the highest perplexity value of DB6V�  over its 19 senses, while
day, with 16 senses, has a much lower perplexity of
H BE8 .
Surprisingly, we observe nouns with high perplexity such as bum (sense perplexity value of 8BA 8 )
achieving PR scores of H BA . While nouns with relatively low perplexity values such as grip (sense
perplexity of ACB6  8 ) yields a low PR score of ACBFQRE .
Moreover, nouns with the same perplexity and similar number of senses yield very different PR scores.
For example, examining holiday and child, both
have the same perplexity of QB H GRG and the number
of senses is close, with 6 and 7 senses, respectively,
however, the PR scores are very different; holiday
yields a PR of ACBA�V , and child achieves a PR of ACBED�� .
Furthermore, nature and art have the same perplexity of QBFQ D ; art has 17 senses while nature has 7
senses only, nonetheless, art yields a much higher
PR score of (ACBED�V ) compared to a PR of ACBGRG for
nature.
These observations are further solidified by the
insignificant correlation of 9 4�� ACB HIQ , % �G% H��Q��
( 4
ACBGW �� P ACB6 
( between sense perplexity and PR.
At first blush, one is inclined to hypothesize that,
the combination of low perplexity associated with a
large number of senses -- as an indication of high
skew in the distribution -- is a good indicator of
high PR, but reviewing the data, this hypothesis is
dispelled by day which has 16 senses and a sense
perplexity of H BE8 , yet yields a low PR score of ACBA�V .
5.4 Semantic Translation Entropy
Semantic translation entropy (STE) (Melamed,
1997) is a special characteristic of the SALAAMtagged training data, since the source of evidence
for SALAAM tagging is multilingual translations.
STE measures the amount of translational variation
for an L1 word in L2, in a parallel corpus. STE is
a variant on the entropy measure. STE is expressed
as follows:
 
% �� !
( 44� H
�
P
!
�%@  !
( B #  T %U�%@  !
( ( (3)
where  is a translation in the set of possible translations
� in L2; and ! is L1 word.
The probability of a translation  is calculated directly from the alignments of the test nouns and
their corresponding translations via the maximum
likelihood estimate.
Variation in translation is beneficial for SALAAM
tagging, therefore, high STE is a desirable feature.
Correlation between the automatic tagging precision and STE is expected to be high if SALAAM
has good quality translations and good quality alignments. However, this correlation is a low 9 4
ACBE8 8 . Consequently, we observe a low correlation
between STE and PR, 9 4 ACBFQRQ , % �G% H��Q��
( 4
H BE8CH�� P ACBFQRE
( .
Examining the data, the nouns bum, detention,
dyke, stress, and yew exhibit both high STE and high
PR; Moreover, there are several nouns that exhibit
low STE and low PR. But the intriguing items are
those that are inconsistent. For instance, child and
holiday: child has an STE of ACBA�V and comprises 7
senses at a low sense perplexity of H BFE D , yet yields
a high PR of ACBED�� . As mentioned earlier, low STE
indicates lack of translational variation. In this specific experimental condition, child is translated as
� enfant, enfantile, ni~
no, ni~
no-peque~
no� , which are
words that preserve ambiguity in both French and
Spanish. On the other hand, holiday has a relatively
high STE value of ACBFERE , yet results in the lowest PR
of ACBA�V . Consequently, we conclude that STE alone
is not a good direct indicator of PR.
5.5 Perplexity Difference
Perplexity difference (PerpDiff) is a measure of the
absolute difference in sense perplexity between the
test data items and the training data items. For the
manually annotated training data items, the overall
correlation between the perplexity measures is a significant 9 4 ACBEDRE which contrasts to a low overall correlation of 9 4 ACBG 8 between the SALAAMtagged training data items and the test data items.
Across the nouns in this study, the correlation between PerpDiff and PR is 9 4 � ACBG . It is advantageous to be as similar as possible to the training
data to guarantee good classification results within
a supervised framework, therefore a low PerpDiff
is desirable. We observe cases with a low PerpDiff
such as holiday (PerpDiff of ACBA�  ), yet the PR is a
low ACBA�V . On the other hand, items such as art have
a relatively high PerpDiff of QBFERQ , but achieves a
high PR of ACBED�� . Accordingly, PerpDiff alone is not
a good indicator of PR.
5.6 Sense Distributional Correlation
Sense Distributional Correlation (SDC) results from
comparing the sense distributions of the test data
items with those of SALAAM-tagged training data
items. It is worth noting that the correlation between the SDC of manually annotated training data
and that of the test data ranges from 9 4 ACBED �
H BA . A strong significant correlation of 9 4 ACB6V�� ,
% �G% H��Q��
( 4 V A1��� ACBA A A H ( between SDC and
PR exists for SALAAM-tagged training data and the
test data. Overall, nouns that yield high PR have
high SDC values. However, there are some instances where this strong correlation is not exhibited. For example, circuit and post have relatively
high SDC values, ACBU� DHG and ACB6V�  D , respectively,
in
 ������� � �CD
, but they score lower PR values than detention which has a comparatively lower
SDC value of ACBU��� E . The fact that both circuit
and post have many senses, 13 and 12, respectively,
while detention has 4 senses only is noteworthy. detention has a higher STE and lower sense perplexity
than either of them however. Overall, the data suggests that SDC is a very good direct indicator of PR.
5.7 Sense Context Confusability
A situation of sense context confusability (SCC)
arises when two senses of a noun are very similar
and are highly uniformly represented in the training examples. This is an artifact of the fine granularity of senses in WordNet 1.7pre. Highly similar senses typically lead to similar usages, therefore
similar contexts, which in a learning framework detract from the learning algorithm's discriminatory
power.
Upon examining the 29 polysemous nouns in the
training and test sets, we observe that a significant
number of the words have similar senses according
to a manual grouping provided by Palmer, in 2002.9
For example, senses 2 and 3 of nature, meaning trait
and quality, respectively, are considered similar by
the manual grouping. The manual grouping does
not provide total coverage of all the noun senses
in this test set. For instance, it only considers the
homonymic senses 1, 2 and 3 of spade, yet, in the
current test set, spade has 6 senses, due to the existence of sub senses.
26 of the 29 test items exhibit multiple groupings
based on the manual grouping. Only three nouns,
detention, dyke, spade do not have any sense groupings. They all, in turn, achieve high PR scores of
H BA .
There are several nouns that have relatively high
SDC values yet their performance ratios are low
such as post, nation, channel and circuit. For instance, nation has a very high SDC value of ACBEDRERQ ,
a low sense perplexity of H BE8 -- relatively close to
the H BFE sense perplexity of the test data -- a sufficient number of contexts (4350), yet it yields a PR
of ACB6  D . According to the manual sense grouping,
senses 1 and 3 are similar, and indeed, upon inspection of the context distributions, we find the bulk
of the senses' instance examples in the SALAAMtagged training data for the condition that yields
this PR in
 �������� � �CD
are annotated with either sense 1 or sense 3, thereby creating confusable
contexts for the learning algorithm. All the cases
of nouns that achieve high PR and possess sense
groups do not have any SCC in the training data
which strongly suggests that SCC is an important
factor to consider when predicting the PR of a system.
5.8 Discussion
We conclude from the above exploration that SDC
and SCC affect PR scores directly. PerpDiff, STE,
and Sense Perplexity, number of senses and number
of contexts seem to have no noticeable direct impact
on the PR.
Based on this observation, we calculate the SDC
values for all the training data used in our experimental conditions for the 29 test items.
Table 3 illustrates the items with the highest SDC
values, in descending order, as yielded from any
of the SALAAM conditions. We use an empirical
cut-off value of ACBU��  for SDC. The SCC values are
reported as a boolean Y/N value, where a Y indicates the presence of a sense confusable context. As
shown a high SDC can serve as a means of auto9

grouping comprises 400 polysemous nouns including the 29
nouns in this evaluation.

matically predicting a high PR, but it is not sufficient. If we eliminate the items where an SCC exists, namely, mouth, post, and authority, we are still
left with nation and circuit, where both yield very
low PR scores. nation has the desirable low PerpDiff of ACBFQRQ . The sense annotation tagging precision of the

in this condition which
yields the highest SDC -- Spanish UN data with

a low STE value of ACB HIQ D . This is due to the fact that
both French and Spanish preserve ambiguity in similar ways to English which does not make it a good
target word for disambiguation within the SALAAM
framework, given these two languages as sources of
evidence. Accordingly, in this case, STE coupled
with the noisy tagging could have resulted in the
low PR. However, for circuit, the STE value for its
respective condition is a high ACBFQ DCH , but we observe
a relatively high PerpDiff of H B6  8 compared to the
PerpDiff of A for the manually annotated data.
Therefore, a combination of high SDC and
nonexistent SCC can reliably predict good PR. But
the other factors still have a role to play in order to
achieve accurate prediction.
It is worth emphasizing that two of the identified
factors are dependent on the test data in this study,
SDC and PerpDiff. One solution to this problem
is to estimate SDC and PerpDiff using a held out
data set that is hand tagged. Such a held out data
set would be considerably smaller than the required
size of a manually tagged training data for a classical supervised WSD system. Hence, SALAAMtagged training data offers a viable solution to the
annotation acquisition bottleneck.
6 Conclusion and Future Directions
In this paper, we applied an unsupervised approach
within a learning framework
 ������� � for the
sense annotation of large amounts of data. The ultimate goal of
 ������ � is to alleviate the data
labelling bottleneck by means of a trade-off between quality and quantity of the training data.
 ������� � is competitive with state-of-the-art unsupervised systems evaluated on the same test set
from SENSEVAL2. Moreover, it yields superior results to those obtained by the only comparable bootstrapping approach when tested on the same data
set. Moreover, we explore, in depth, different factors that directly and indirectly affect the performance of
 �������� � quantified as a performance
ratio, PR. Sense Distribution Correlation (SDC) and
Sense Context Confusability (SCC) have the highest
direct impact on performance ratio, PR. However,
evidence suggests that probably a confluence of all
the different factors leads to the best prediction of
an acceptable PR value. An investigation into the
feasibility of combining these different factors with
the different attributes of the experimental conditions for SALAAM to automatically predict when the
noisy training data can reliably replace manually annotated data is a matter of future work.
