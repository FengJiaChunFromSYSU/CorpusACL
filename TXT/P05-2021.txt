Abstract
Large vocabulary continuous speech
recognition of inflective languages, such
as Czech, Russian or Serbo-Croatian, is
heavily deteriorated by excessive out of
vocabulary rate. In this paper, we tackle
the problem of vocabulary selection, language modeling and pruning for inflective
languages. We show that by explicit
reduction of out of vocabulary rate we
can achieve significant improvements
in recognition accuracy while almost
preserving the model size. Reported
results are on Czech speech corpora.
1 Introduction
Large vocabulary continuous speech recognition of
inflective languages is a challenging task for mainly
two reasons. Rich morphology generates huge number of forms which are not captured by limited-size
dictionaries, and therefore leads to worse recognition results. Relatively free word order admits enormous number of word sequences and thus impoverishes � -gram language models. In this paper we are
concerned with the former issue.
Previous work which deals with excessive vocabulary growth goes mainly in two lines. Authors have
either decided to break words into sub-word units or
to adapt dictionaries in a multi-pass scenario. On
Czech data, (Byrne et al., 2001) suggest to use linguistically motivated recognition units. Words are
broken down to stems and endings and used as the
recognition units in the first recognition phase. In
the second phase, stems and endings are concatenated. On Serbo-Croatian, (Geutner et al., 1998)
also tested morphemes as the recognition units. Both
groups of authors agreed that this approach is not
beneficial for speech recognition of inflective languages. Vocabulary adaptation, however, brought
considerable improvement. Both (Icring and Psutka,
2001) on Czech and (Geutner et al., 1998) on SerboCroatian reported substantial reduction of word error rate. Both authors followed the same procedure.
In the first pass, they used a dictionary composed
of the most frequent words. Generated lattices were
then processed to get a list of all words which appeared in them. This list served as a basis for a new
adapted dictionary into which morphological variants were added.
It can be concluded that large corpora contain a
host of words which are ignored during estimation
of language models used in first pass, despite the fact
that these rare words can bring substantial improvement. Therefore, it is desirable to explore how to incorporate rare or even unseen words into a language
model which can be used in a first pass.
2 Language Model
Language models used in a first pass of current
speech recognition systems are usually built in the
following way. First, a text corpus is acquired.
In case of broadcast news, a newspaper collection
or news transcriptions are a good source. Second,
most frequent words are picked out to form a dictionary. Dictionary size is typically in tens of thousand
words. For English, for example, dictionaries of size
121
of 60k words sufficiently cover common domains.
(Of course, for recognition of entries listed in the
Yellow pages, such limited dictionaries are clearly
inappropriate.) Third, an � -gram language model is
estimated. In case of Katz back-off model, the conditional bigram word probability is estimated as
����������!#"�$���  � �� 
if %
��� ��'& �  )(10
2434��� �� 65 "�$���  
otherwise
(1)
where "�
represents a smoothed probability distribution,
2434�7
stands for the back-off weight, and %
�98@
denotes the count of its argument. Back-off model
can be also nicely viewed as a finite state automaton
as depicted in Figure 1.

To alleviate the problem of a high OOV, we suggest to gather supplementary words and add them

Several sources can be exploited to obtain supplementary dictionaries. Morphology tools can derive words which are close to those observed in corpus. In such a case,

Having prior domain knowledge, new words which
are expected to appear in audio recordings might be
collected and added into

. Consider an example
of transcribing an ice-hockey tournament. Names
of new players are desirably in the vocabulary. Another source of
d
are the words which fell below
the selection threshold of
Y
. In large corpora, there
are hundreds of thousands words which are omitted
from the estimated language model. We suggest to
put them into
d
. As it turned out, unigram probability of these words is very low, so it is suitable to
increase their score to make them competitive with
other words in

during recognition.

injected by a supplementary dictionary
Note that the probability of a word given its history is no longer proper probability. It does not adds
up to one. We decided not to normalize the model
for two reasons. First, we used a decoder which
searches for the best path using Viterbi criterion, so
there's no need for normalization. Second, normalization would have involved recomputing all backoff model weights and could also enforce re-tuning
of the language model scaling factor. To rule out
any variation which the re-tuning of the scaling factor could bring, we decided not to normalize the new
model.
In finite-state representation, injection of a new
dictionary was implemented as depicted in Figure
2. Supplementary words form a loop in the back-off
state.

3 Experiments
We have evaluated our approach on two corpora,
Czech Broadcast News and the Czech portion of
MALACH data.
3.1 Czech Broadcast News Data
The Czech Broadcast News (Radov�
a et al., 2004) is
a collection of both radio and TV news in Czech.
Weather forecast, traffic announcements and sport
news were excluded from this corpus. Our training portion comprises 22 hours of speech. To tune
the language model scaling factor and additional LM
parameters, we set aside 100 sentences. The test set
consists of 2500 sentences.
We used the HTK toolkit (Young et al., 1999) to
extract acoustic features from sampled signal and to
estimate acoustic models. As acoustic features we
used 12 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients plus
energy and delta and delta-delta features. We trained
a triphone acoustic model with tied mixtures of continuous density Gaussians.
As a LM training corpus we exploited a collection
of newspaper articles from the Lidov�
e Noviny (LN)
newspaper. This collection was published as a part
of the Prague Dependency Treebank by LDC (Haji
c
et al., 2001). This corpus contains 33 million tokens.
Its vocabulary contains more than 650k word forms.
OOV rates are displayed in Table 1.
Dict. size OOV
60k 8.27%
80k 6.92%
124k 5.20%
371k 2.23%
658k 1.63%
Table 1: OOV rate of transcriptions of the test data.
Dictionaries contain the most frequent words.
As can be readily observed, moderate-size vocabularies don't sufficiently cover the test data transcriptions. Therefore they are one of the major
sources of poor recognition performance.
The baseline language model was estimated from
60k most frequent words. It was a bigram Katz
back-off model with Knesser-Ney smoothing pruned
by the entropy-based method (Stolcke, 1998).
As the supplementary dictionary we took the rest
of words from the LN corpus. To learn the impact
of injection of infrequent words, we carried out two
experiments.
First, we built a uniform loop which was injected
into the back-off model. The uniform distribution
was tuned on the held-out data. Tuning of this constant is displayed in Table 2.
Uniform scale WER
12 18.89%
11 18.68%
10 18.40%
9 21.00%
Table 2: Tuning of uniform distribution on the heldout set. WER denotes the word error rate.
Second, we took relative frequencies multiplied
by a shift coefficient as the injected model scores.
This shift coefficient was again tuned on held-out
data as shown in Table 3.
Unigram shift WER
no shift 19.52%
wTx 18.54%
wHy 17.91%
wT 18.75%
Table 3: Tuning of the shift coefficient of unigram
model on the held-out set.
Then, we took the best parameters and used them
for recognition of the test data. Recognition results are depicted in Figure 4. The injection of supplementary words helped decrease both recognition
word error rate and oracle word error rate. By oracle
WER is meant WER of the path, stored in the generated lattice, which best matches the utterance regardless the scores. In other words, oracle WER gives us
a bound on how well can we get by tuning scores in
a given lattice. Injection of shifted unigram model
brought relative improvement of 13.6% in terms of
WER over the 60k baseline model. Uniform injection brought also significant improvement despite its
simplicity. Indeed, we observed more than 10% relative improvement in terms of WER. In terms of oracle WER, unigram injection brought more than 30%
relative improvement.

60k + Unigram injection 25.21% 11.03%
Table 4: Evaluation on 2500 test sentences. OWER
stands for the oracle error rate.
It's worthwhile to mention the model size, since it
could be argued that the improvement was achieved
by an enormous increase of the model. We decided to measure the model size using two factors.
The disk space occupied by the language model and
the disk space taken up by the so-called CLG. By
CLG we mean a transducer which maps triphones
to words augmented with the model scores. This
transducer represents the search space investigated
during recognition. More details on transducers in
speech recognition can be found in (Mohri et al.,
2002). Table 5 summarizes the sizes of the evaluated models.
Model CLG size G size
Baseline 60k 399MB 106MB
60k + Uniform 405MB 115MB
60k + Unigram 405MB 115MB
Baseline 80k 441MB 116MB
Table 5: Model size comparison measured in disk
space. G denotes a language model compiled as
a finite-state automaton. CLG denotes transducer
mapping triphones to words augmented with model
scores.
Injection of supplementary words increased the
model size only slightly. To see the difference in the
size of injected models and traditionally built ones,
we constructed a model of 80k most frequent words
and pruned with the same threshold as the 60k LM.
Not only did this 80k model give worse recognition
results, but it also proved to be bigger.
3.2 MALACH Data
The next data we tested our approach on was
the Czech portion of the MALACH corpus
(http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/research/malach).
MALACH is a multilingual audio-visual corpus.
It contains recordings of survivors of World War
II talking about war events. 600 people spoke in
Czech, but only 350 recordings had been digitized
till end of 2003. The interviewer and the interviewee
had separate microphones, and were recorded on
separate stereo channels. Recordings were stored in
the MPEG-1 format. Average length of a testimony
is 1.9 hours.
30 minutes from each testimony were transcribed
and used as training data. 10 testimonies were transcribed completely and used for testing. The acoustic model used 15-dimensional PLP cepstral features, sampled at 10 msec. Modeling was done using
the HTK Toolkit.
The baseline language model was estimated from
transcriptions of the survivors' testimonies. We
worked with the standardized version of the transcriptions. More details regarding the Czech portion
of the MALACH data can be found in (Psutka et al.,
2004). Transcriptions are 610k words long and the
entire vocabulary comprises 41k words. We refer to
this corpus as TR 41k.
To obtain a supplementary vocabulary, we used
Czech morphology tools (Haji
c and Vidov�
a-Hladk�
a,
1998). Out of 41k words we generated 416k words
which were the inflected forms of the observed
words in the corpus. Note that we posed restrictions
on the generation procedure to avoid obsolete, archaic and uncommon expressions. To do so, we ran
a Czech tagger on the transcriptions and thus obtained a list of all morphological tags of observed
forms. The morphological generation was then confined to this set of tags.
Since there is no corpus to train unigram scores
of generated words on, we set the LM score of the
generated forms to a constant.
The transcriptions are not the only source of text
data in the MALACH project. (Psutka et al., 2004)
searched the Czech National Corpus (CNC) for sentences which are similar to the transcriptions. This
additional corpus contains almost 16 million words,
330k types. CNC vocabulary overlaps to a large extent with TR vocabulary. This fact is not surprising
since the selection criterion was based on a lemma
unigram probability. Table 6 summarizes OOV rates
of several dictionaries.
We estimated several language models. The baseline models are pruned bigram back-off models with
Knesser-Ney smoothing. The baseline word error

rate of the model built solely from transcriptions was
37.35%. We injected constant loop of morphological variants into this model. In terms of text coverage, this action reduced OOV from 5.07% to 2.74%.
In terms of recognition word error rate, we observed
a relative improvement of 3.5%.
In the next experiment we took as the baseline LM
a linear interpolation of the LM built from transcriptions and a model estimated from the CNC corpus.
Into this model, we injected a unigram loop of all
the available words. That is the rest of words from
the CNC corpus with unigram scores and words provided by morphology which were not already in the
model. Table 7 summarizes the achieved WER and
oracle WER. Given the fact that the injection only
slightly reduced the OOV rate, a small relative reduction of 2.3% matched our expectations.

Table 7: Word error rate and oracle WER for baseline and injected models. Uniform Morph refers
to the constant uniform loop of the morphologygenerated words. Inj denotes the loop of the rest
of words of the CNC corpus and the morphologygenerated words.
To learn how the injection affected model size, we
measured size of the language model automaton and
the optimized triphone-to-word transducer. As in the
case of the LN corpus, injection increased the model
size only moderately. Sizes of the models are shown
in Table 8.

represents the loop of words generated by morphology. Inj is the loop of all words from CNC which
were not included in CNC language model, moreover, Inj also contains words generated by the morphology.
4 Conclusion
In this paper, we have suggested to inject a loop
of supplementary words into the back-off state of a
first-pass language model. As it turned out, addition
of rare or morphology-generated words into a language model can considerably decrease both recognition word error rate and oracle WER in single
recognition pass. In the recognition of Czech Broadcast News, we achieved 13.6% relative improvement
in terms of word error rate. In terms of oracle error rate, we observed more than 30% relative improvement. On the MALACH data, we attained only
marginal word error rate reduction. Since the text
corpora already covered the transcribed speech relatively well, a smaller OOV reduction translated into
a smaller word error rate reduction. In the near future, we would like to test our approach on agglutinative languages, where the problems with high
OOV are even more challenging. We would also like
to experiment with more complex language models.
