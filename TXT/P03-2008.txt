Abstract
This paper investigates an application of
the ranked region algebra to information
retrieval from large scale but unannotated
documents. We automatically annotated
documents with document structure and
semantic tags by using taggers, and retrieve information by specifying structure represented by tags and words using
ranked region algebra. We report in detail
what kind of data can be retrieved in the
experiments by this approach.
1 Introduction
In the biomedical area, the number of papers is very
large and increases, as it is difficult to search the information. Although keyword-based retrieval systems can be applied to a database of papers, users
may not get the information they want since the relations between these keywords are not specified. If
the document structures, such as "title", "sentence",
"author", and relation between terms are tagged in
the texts, then the retrieval is improved by specifying such structures. Models of the retrieval specifying both structures and words are pursued by many
researchers (Chinenyanga and Kushmerick, 2001;
Wolff et al., 1999; Theobald and Weilkum, 2000;
Deutsch et al., 1998; Salminen and Tompa, 1994;
Clarke et al., 1995). However, these models are not
robust unlike keyword-based retrieval, that is, they
retrieve only the exact matches for queries.
In the previous research (Masuda et al., 2003), we
proposed a new ranking model that enables proximal
and structural search for structured text. This paper
investigates an application of the ranked region algebra to information retrieval from large scale but
unannotated documents. We reports in detail what
kind of data can be retrieved in the experiments. Our
approach is to annotate documents with document
structures and semantic tags by taggers automatically, and to retrieve information by specifying both
structures and words using ranked region algebra. In
this paper, we apply our approach to the OHSUMED
test collection (Hersh et al., 1994), which is a public
test collection for information retrieval in the field
of biomedical science but not tag-annotated. We annotate OHSUMED by various taggers and retrieve
information from the tag-annotated corpus.
We have implemented the ranking model in our
retrieval engine, and had preliminary experiments to
evaluate our model. In the experiments, we used
the GENIA corpus (Ohta et al., 2002) as a small but
manually tag-annotated corpus, and OHSUMED as
a large but automatically tag-annotated corpus. The
experiments show that our model succeeded in retrieving the relevant answers that an exact-matching
model fails to retrieve because of lack of robustness,
and the relevant answers that a non-structured model
fails because of lack of structural specification. We
report how structural specification works and how it
doesn't work in the experiments with OHSUMED.
Section 2 explains the region algebra. In Section
3, we describe our ranking model for the structured
query and texts. In Section 4, we show the experimental results of this system.

2 Background: Region algebra
The region algebra (Salminen and Tompa, 1994;
Clarke et al., 1995; Jaakkola and Kilpelainen, 1999)
is a set of operators representing the relation between the extents (i.e. regions in texts), where an
extent is represented by a pair of positions, beginning and ending position. Region algebra allows for
the specification of the structure of text.
In this paper, we suppose the region algebra proposed in (Clarke et al., 1995). It has seven operators as shown in Table 1; four containment operators (�, �, �, �) representing the containment relation between the extents, two combination operators ( , ) corresponding to "and" and "or" operator of the boolean model, and ordering operator
(Q) representing the order of words or structures in
the texts. A containment relation between the extents is represented as follows: e = (ps, pe) contains
e = (ps, pe) iff ps  ps  pe  pe (we express this
relation as e a e ). The result of retrieval is a set of
non-nested extents, that is defined by the following
function  over a set of extents S:
(S) = {e|e  S e  S.(e = e  e ` e)}

Figure 2: Subqueries of the query `[book] � ([title]
� "retrieval")'
Intuitively, (S) is an operation for finding the
shortest matching. A set of non-nested extents
matching query q is expressed as Gq.
For convenience of explanation, we represent a
query as a tree structure as shown in Figure 1 (`[x]'
is a abbreviation of ` x Q /x '). This query represents `Retrieve the books whose title has the word
"retrieval." '
The algorithm for finding an exact match of a
query works efficiently. The time complexity of the
algorithm is linear to the size of a query and the size
of documents (Clarke et al., 1995).
3 A Ranking Model for Structured
Queries and Texts
This section describes the definition of the relevance
between a document and a structured query represented by the region algebra. The key idea is that a
structured query is decomposed into subqueries, and
the relevance of the whole query is represented as a
vector of relevance measures of subqueries.
Our model assigns a relevance measure of the
query matching extents in (1,15) matching extents in (16,30) constructed by
q1 " book " (1,1) (16,16) inverted list
q2 " /book " (15,15) (30,30) inverted list
q3 " title " (2,2), (7,7) (17,17), (22,22) inverted list
q4 " /title " (5,5), (11,11) (20,20), (27,27) inverted list
q5 "retrieval" (4,4), (13,13) (28,28) inverted list
q6 `[title]' (2,5), (7,11) (17,20), (22,27) Gq3 , Gq4
q7 `[title] � "retrieval"' (2,5) Gq5 , Gq6
q8 `[book]' (1,15) (16,30) Gq1 , Gq2
q9 `[book] � ([title] � "retrieval")' (1,15) Gq7 , Gq8

Figure 3: An example text
structured query as a vector of relevance measures
of the subqueries. In other words, the relevance
is defined by the number of portions matched with
subqueries in a document. If an extent matches a
subquery of query q, the extent will be somewhat
relevant to q even when the extent does not exactly
match q. Figure 2 shows an example of a query and
its subqueries. In this example, even when an extent
does not match the whole query exactly, if the extent matches "retrieval" or `[title]�"retrieval"', the
extent is considered to be relevant to the query. Subqueries are formally defined as follows.
Definition 1 (Subquery) Let q be a given query
and n1, ..., nm be the nodes of q. Subqueries
q1, ..., qm of q are the subtrees of q. Each qi has
node ni as a root node.
When a relevance (qi, d) between a subquery
qi and a document d is given, the relevance of the
whole query is defined as follows.
Definition 2 (Relevance of the whole query) Let q
be a given query, d be a document and q1, ..., qm be
subqueries of q. The relevance vector (q, d) of d is
defined as follows:
(q, d) = (q1, d), (q2, d), ..., (qm, d)
A relevance of a subquery should be defined similarly to that of keyword-based queries in the traditional ranked retrieval. For example, TFIDF, which
is used in our experiments in Section 4, is the most
simple and straightforward one, while other relevance measures recently proposed (Robertson and
Walker, 2000; Fuhr, 1992) can be applied. TF of a
subquery is calculated using the number of extents
matching the subquery, and IDF of a subquery is
calculated using the number of documents including the extents matching the subquery. When a
text is given as Figure 3 and document collection is
{(1,15),(16,30)}, extents matching each subquery in
each document are shown in Table 2. TF and IDF
are calculated using the number of extents matching
subquery in Table 2.
While we have defined a relevance of the structured query as a vector, we need to arrange the documents according to the relevance vectors. In this
paper, we first map a vector into a scalar value,
and then sort the documents according to this scalar
measure.
Three methods are introduced for the mapping
from the relevance vector to the scalar measure. The
first one simply works out the sum of the elements
of the relevance vector.
Definition 3 (Simple Sum)
sum(q, d) =
m
i=1
(qi, d)
The second appends a coefficient representing the
rareness of the structures. When the query is A � B
or A � B, if the number of extents matching the
query is close to the number of extents matching A,
matching the query does not seem to be very important because it means that the extents that match A
mostly match A�B or A�B. The case of the other
operators is the same as with � and �.
Num Query
1 `([cons] � ([sem] � "G#DNA domain or region")) ("in" Q ([cons] � ([sem] � ("G#tissue" "G#body part"))))'
2 `([event] � ([obj] � "gene")) ("in" Q ([cons] � ([sem] � ("G#tissue" "G#body part"))))'
3 `([event]�([obj]Q([sem]�"G#DNA domain or region"))) ("in"Q([cons]�([sem]�("G#tissue" "G#body part"))))'
Table 3: Queries submitted in the experiments on the GENIA corpus
Definition 4 (Structure Coefficient) When the operator op is , or Q, the structure coefficient of
the query A op B is:
scAopB =
C(A) + C(B) - C(A op B)
C(A) + C(B)
and when the operator op is � or �, the structure
coefficient of the query A op B is:
scAopB =
C(A) - C(A op B)
C(A)
where A and B are the queries and C(A) is the number of extents that match A in the document collection.
The scalar measure sc(qi, d) is then defined as
sc(q, d) =
m
i=1
scqi � (qi, d)
The third is a combination of the measure of the
query itself and the measure of the subqueries. Although we calculate the score of extents by subqueries instead of using only the whole query, the
score of subqueries can not be compared with the
score of other subqueries. We assume normalized
weight of each subquery and interpolate the weight
of parent node and children nodes.
Definition 5 (Interpolated Coefficient) The interpolated coefficient of the query qi is recursively defined as follows:
ic(qi, d) =  � (qi, d) + (1 - ) ci
ic(qci , d)
l
where ci is the child of node ni, l is the number of
children of node ni, and 0    1.
This formula means that the weight of each node is
defined by a weighted average of the weight of the
query and its subqueries. When  = 1, the weight
of a query is normalized weight of the query. When
 = 0, the weight of a query is calculated from the
weight of the subqueries, i.e. the weight is calculated by only the weight of the words used in the
query.
4 Experiments
In this section, we show the results of our preliminary experiments of text retrieval using our model.
We used the GENIA corpus (Ohta et al., 2002) and
the OHSUMED test collection (Hersh et al., 1994).
We compared three retrieval models, i) our model,
ii) exact matching of the region algebra (exact), and
iii) not structured model (flat). The queries submitted to our system are shown in Table 3 and 4. In
the flat model, the query was submitted as a query
composed of the words in the queries connected by
the "and" operator ( ). For example, in the case of
Query 1, the query submitted to the system in the
flat model is ` "G#DNA domain or region" "in"
"G#tissue" "G#body part" .' The system output the ten results that had the highest relevance for
each model.
In the following experiments, we used a computer
that had Pentium III 1.27GHz CPU, 4GB memory.
The system was implemented in C++ with Berkeley
DB library.
4.1 GENIA corpus
The GENIA corpus is an XML document composed of paper abstracts in the field of biomedical science. The corpus consisted of 1,990 articles, 873,087 words (including tags), and 16,391
sentences. In the GENIA corpus, the document
structure was annotated by tags such as " article "
and " sentence ", technical terms were annotated by
" cons ", and events were annotated by " event ".
The queries in Table 3 are made by an expert in
the field of biomedicine. The document was "sentence" in this experiments. Query 1 retrieves sentences including a gene in a tissue. Queries 2 and
3 retrieve sentences representing an event having a
gene as an object and occurring in a tissue. In Query
2, a gene was represented by the word "gene," and in
Query 3, a gene was represented by the annotation
"G#DNA domain or region."

OHSUMED. The first line is a query submitted to the system, the second and third lines are the original query
of the OHSUMED test collection, the second is information of patient and the third is request information.
For the exact model, ten results were selected randomly from the exactly matched results if the number of results was more than ten. The results are
blind tested, i.e., after we had the results for each
model, we shuffled these results randomly for each
query, and the shuffled results were judged by an expert in the field of biomedicine whether they were
relevant or not.
Table 5 shows the number of the results that were
judged relevant in the top ten results. The results
show that our model was superior to the exact and
flat models for all queries. Compared to the exact
model, our model output more relevant documents,
since our model allows the partial matching of the
query, which shows the robustness of our model. In
addition, our model gives a better result than the flat
model, which means that the structural specification
of the query was effective for finding the relevant
documents.
Comparing our models, the number of relevant results using sc was the same as that of sum. The results using ic varied between the results of the flat
model and the results of the exact model depending
on the value of .

ical science. The collection has a query set and a
list of relevant documents for each query. From 50
to 300 documents are judged whether or not relevant to each query. The query consisted of patient
information and information request. We used title, abstract, and human-assigned MeSH term fields
of documents in the experiments. Since the original OHSUMED is not annotated with tags, we annotated it with tags representing document structures such as " article " and " sentence ", and annotated technical terms with tags such as " disease "
and " therapeutic " by longest matching of terms of
Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). In the
OHSUMED, relations between technical terms such
as events were not annotated unlike the GENIA corpus. The collection consisted of 348,566 articles,
78,207,514 words (including tags), and 1,731,953
sentences.
12 of 106 queries of OHSUMED are converted
into structured queries of Region Algebra by an expert in the field of biomedicine. These queries are
shown in Table 4, and submitted to the system. The
document was "article" in this experiments. For the
exact model, all exact matches of the whole query
were judged. Since there are documents that are not
judged whether or not relevant to the query in the
OHSUMED, we picked up only the documents that
are judged.
Table 6 shows the number of relevant results in
top ten results. The results show that our model succeeded in finding the relevant results that the exact
model could not find, and was superior to the flat
model for Query 4, 5, and 6. However, our model
was inferior to the flat model for Query 14 and 15.
Comparing our models, the number of relevant
results using sc and ic was lower than that using
sum.

4.3 Discussion
In the experiments on OHSUMED, the number of
relevant documents of our model were less than that
of the flat model in some queries. We think this is
because i) specifying structures was not effective, ii)
weighting subqueries didn't work, iii) MeSH terms
embedded in the documents are effective for the flat
model and not effective for our model, iv) or there
are many documents that our system found relevant
but were not judged since the OHSUMED test collection was made using keyword-based retrieval.
As for i), structural specification in the queries
is not well-written because the exact model failed
to achieve high precision and its coverage is very
low. We used only tags specifying technical terms as
structures in the experiments on OHSUMED. This
structure was not so effective because these tags are
annotated by longest match of terms. We need to
use the tags representing relations between technical terms to improve the results. Moreover, structured query used in the experiments may not specify
the request information exactly. Therefore we think
converting queries written by natural language into
the appropriate structured queries is important, and
lead to the question answering using variously tagannotated texts.
As for ii), we think the weighting didn't work
because we simply use frequency of subqueries for
weighting. To improve the weighting, we have to
assign high weight to the structure concerned with
user's intention, that are written in the request information. This is shown in the results of Query
9. In Query 9, relevant documents were not retrieved except the model using ic, because although
the request information was information concerned
"lupus nephritis", the weight concerned with "lupus nephritis" was smaller than that concerned with
"thrombotic" and "thrombocytopenic purpura" in
the models except ic. Because the structures concerning with user's intention did not match the most
weighted structures in the model, the relevant documents were not retrieved.
As for iii), MeSH terms are human-assigned keywords for each documents, and no relation exists
across a boundary of each MeSH terms. in the
flat model, these MeSH term will improve the results. However, in our model, the structure sometimes matches that are not expected. For example,
In the case of Query 14, the subquery ` "chronic"
Q "fatigue" Q "syndrome" ' matched in the field of
MeSH term across a boundary of terms when the
MeSH term field was text such as "Affective Disorders/*CO; Chronic Disease; Fatigue/*PX; Human;
Syndrome " because the operator Q has no limitation of distance.
As for iv), the OHSUMED test collection was
constructed by attaching the relevance judgement to
the documents retrieved by keyword-based retrieval.
To show the effectiveness of structured retrieval
more clearly, we need test collection with (structured) query and lists of relevant documents, and the
tag-annotated documents, for example, tags representing the relation between the technical terms such
as "event", or taggers that can annotate such tags.
Table 7 and 8 show that the retrieval time increases corresponding to the size of the document
collection. The system is efficient enough for information retrieval for a rather small document set like
GENIA corpus. To apply to the huge databases such
as Web-based applications, we might require a constant time algorithm, which should be the subject of
future research.
5 Conclusions and Future work
We proposed an approach to retrieve information
from documents which are not annotated with any
tags. We annotated documents with document structures and semantic tags by taggers, and retrieved
information by using ranked region algebra. We
showed what kind of data can be retrieved from documents in the experiments.
In the discussion, we showed several points about
the ranked retrieval for structured texts. Our future
work is to improve a model, corpus etc. to improve
the ranked retrieval for structured texts.
