Abstract
Dialog participants in a non-mixed initiative dialogs, in which one participant
asks questions exclusively and the other
participant responds to those questions
exclusively, can select actions that minimize the expected length of the dialog.
The choice of question that minimizes
the expected number of questions to be
asked can be computed in polynomial
time in some cases.
The polynomial-time solutions to special cases of the problem suggest a number of strategies for selecting dialog actions in the intractable general case. In
a simulation involving 1000 dialog scenarios, an approximate solution using
the most probable rule set/least probable question resulted in expected dialog
length of 3.60 questions per dialog, as
compared to 2.80 for the optimal case,
and 5.05 for a randomly chosen strategy.
1 Introduction
Making optimal choices in unconstrained natural
language dialogs may be impossible. The difficulty of defining consistent, meaningful criteria
for which behavior can be optimized and the infinite number of possible actions that may be taken
at any point in an unconstrained dialog present
generally insurmountable obstacles to optimization.
Computing the optimal dialog action may be
intractable even in a simple, highly constrained
model of dialog with narrowly defined measures
of success. This paper presents an analysis of the
optimal behavior of a participant in non-mixed initiative dialogs, a restricted but important class of
dialogs.
2 Non-mixed initiative dialogs
In recent years, dialog researchers have focused
much attention on the study of mixed-initiative
behaviors in natural language dialogs. In general, mixed initiative refers to the idea that control over the content and direction of a dialog may
pass from one participant to another. 1 Cohen et
al. (1998) provides a good overview of the various definitions of dialog initiative that have been
proposed. Our work adopts a definition similar to
Guinn (1999), who posits that initiative attaches to
specific dialog goals.
This paper considers non-mixed-initiative dialogs, which we shall take to mean dialogs with
the following characteristics:
1. The dialog has two participants, the leader
and the follower, who are working cooperatively to achieve some mutually desired dialog goal.
2. The leader may request information from the
follower, or may inform the follower that the
dialog has succeeded or failed to achieve the
dialog goal.
1
There is no generally accepted consensus as to how initiative should be defined.
3. The follower may only inform the leader of a
fact in direct response to a request for information from the leader, or inform the leader
that it cannot fulfill a particular request.
The model assumes the leader knows sets of questions  ����
��� � � ���� �� � "!$#
� � � %�� �� �% �&#
.
.
.
��' � � �'(�� ') '0 21(#
such that if all questions in any one set �� are
answered successfully by the follower, the dialog goal will be satisfied. The sets will be referred to hereafter as rule sets. The leader's
task is to find a rule set � whose constituent
questions can all be successfully answered. The
method is to choose a sequence of questions
 �3!4 �5!% � &  � & 6 �87% �97 which will lead to its discovery.
For example, in a dialog in a customer service
setting in which the leader attempts to locate the
follower's account in a database, the leader might
request the follower's name and account number,
or might request the name and telephone number. The corresponding rule sets for such a dialog would be �@BA2CEDF@HGPIQ@BA2CERTSVU2WXIDYU"# and
�@EA6CEDF@HGPIQ@BA2CE`ba%a%c4DYU"# .
One complicating factor in the leader's task is
that a question   �d � in one rule set may occur in
several other rule sets so that choosing to ask  �3 �
can have ramifications for several sets.
We assume that for every question  6�3 � the leader
knows an associated probability e �3 � that the follower has the knowledge necessary to answer  2�3 � .2
These probabilities enable us to compute an expected length for a dialog, measured by the number of questions asked by the leader. Our goal in
selecting a sequence of questions will be to minimize the expected length of the dialog.
The probabilities may be estimated by aggregating the results from all interactions, or a more sophisticated individualized model might be maintained for each participant. Some examples of
how these probabilities might be estimated can be

In addition to modeling the follower's knowledge, these
probabilities can also model aspects of the dialog system's
performance, such as the recognition rate of an automatic
speech recognizer.
found in (Conati et al., 2002; Zukerman and Albrecht, 2001).
Our model of dialog derives from rule-based
theories of dialog structure, such as (Perrault and
Allen, 1980; Grosz and Kraus, 1996; Lochbaum,
1998). In particular, this form of the problem models exactly the "missing axiom theory" of Smith
and Hipp (1994; 1995) which proposes that dialog is aimed at proving the top-level goal in a
theorem-proving tree and "missing axioms" in the
proof provide motivation for interactions with the
dialog partner. The rule sets �2� are sets of missing
axioms that are sufficient to complete the proof of
the top-level goal.
Our format is quite general and can model other
dialog systems as well. For example, a dialog system that is organized as a decision tree with a question at the root, with additional questions at successor branches, can be modeled by our format.
As an example, suppose we have toplevel goal cf� and these rules to prove it:
(c4 AND  � ) implies cf�
( �� OR  %� ) implies c .
The corresponding rule sets are
��� = � ��� ��#
� = � �%�� ��# .
If all of the questions in either � � or �  are
satisfied, cf� will be proven. If we have values for
the probabilities e �� e � , and e %� , we can design
an optimum ordering of the questions to minimize
the expected length of dialogs. Thus if e �� is
much smaller than e %� , we would ask   %� before
asking  ��� . The reader might try to decide when
 � should be asked before any other questions in
order to minimize the expected length of dialogs.
The rest of the paper examines how the leader
can select the questions which minimize the overall expected length of the dialog, as measured by
the number of questions asked. Each questionresponse pair is considered to contribute equally
to the length. Sections 3, 4, and 5 describe
polynomial-time algorithms for finding the optimum order of questions in three special instances
of the question ordering optimization problem.
Section 6 gives a polynomial-time method to approximate optimum behavior in the general case of
W rule sets which may have many common questions.
3 Case: One rule set
Many dialog tasks can be modeled with a single
rule set � � � �� ��  # . For example, a
leader might ask the follower to supply values for
each field in a form. Here the optimum strategy is
to ask the questions first that have the least probability of being successfully answered.
Theorem 1. Given a rule set � � �  � 6  # ,
asking the questions in the order of their probability of success (least first) results in the minimum expected dialog length; that is, for
� �
� W�� �  e ��� e ��� � where e � is the probability
that the follower will answer question  6� successfully.
A formal proof is available in a longer version
of this paper. Informally, we have two cases; the
first assumes that all questions  6� are answered
successfully, leading to a dialog length of W , since
W questions will be asked and then answered.
The second case assumes that some  6� will not
be answered successfully. The expected length
increases as the probabilities of success of the
questions asked increases. However, the expected
length does not depend on the probability of success for the last question asked, since no questions
follow it regardless of the outcome. Therefore, the
question with the greatest probability of success
appears at the end of the optimal ordering. Similarly, we can show that given the last question in
the ordering, the expected length does not depend
upon the probability of the second to last question
in the ordering, and so on until all questions have
been placed in the proper position. The optimal ordering is in order of increasing probability of success.
4 Case: Two independent rule sets
We now consider a dialog scenario in which the
leader has two rule sets for completing the dialog
task.
Definition 4.1. Two rule sets �"� and � are independent if �Q��Y� � . If ����P� is non-empty,
then the members of �H��F� are said to be common to �Q� and � . A question   is unique to rule
set � if   � and for all �� � ,    �!
In a dialog scenario in which the leader has
multiple, mutually independent rule sets for accomplishing the dialog goal, the result of asking a
question contained in one rule set has no effect on
the success or failure of the other rule sets known
by the leader. Also, it can be shown that if the
leader makes optimal decisions at each turn in the
dialog, once the leader begins asking questions belonging to one rule set, it should continue to ask
questions from the same rule set until the rule set
either succeeds or fails. The problem of selecting the question that minimizes the expected dialog length "$#&%(' becomes the problem of selecting
which rule set should be used first by the leader.
Once the rule set has been selected, Theorem 1
shows how to select a question from the selected
rule set that minimizes "$#&%(' .
By expected dialog length, we mean the usual
definition of expectation
")#&%0' �2143 #e ��U56U687 '9#&% IWA@HcS U!6B7 ' 
Thus, to calculate the expected length of a dialog,
we must be able to enumerate all of the possible
outcomes of that dialog, along with the probability
of that outcome occurring, and the length associated with that outcome.
Before we show how the leader should decide
which rule set it should use first, we introduce
some notation.
The expected length in case of failure for an
ordering U �  �� � of the questions of a
rule set � is the expected length of the dialog that
would result if � were the only rule set available to
the leader, the leader asked questions in the order
given by U , and one of the questions in � failed.

The factor

�dcfe Gg I !ihpPq gRr is a scaling factor that accounts for the fact that we are counting only cases
in which the dialog fails. We will let 6 � represent
the minimum expected length in case of failure for
rule set �� , obtained by ordering the questions of ��
by increasing probability of success, as per Theorem 1.
The probability of success A of a rule set
� � � ��� �2  # is s �ut � e � . The definition
of probability of success of a rule set assumes that
the probabilities of success for individual questions are mutually independent.
Theorem 2. Let   � ���Q���6# be the set of mutually independent rule sets available to the leader
for accomplishing the dialog goal. For a rule set
� � in   , let A � be the probability of success of � � , W �
be the number of questions in �2� , and 62� be the minimum expected length in case of failure. To minimize the expected length of the dialog, the leader
should select the question with the least probability of success from the rule set �2� with the least
value of W ��� 62� #

Proof: If the leader uses questions from �B� first,
the expected dialog length "$#&% � ' is
AQ�4W ��� # � �bA�� ' A6 # 6"��� W  ' � # � � A�� '9# � � A6 '9# 6"��� 6 '
The first term, AH�W � , is the probability of success
for ��� times the length of �H� . The second term,
# � � A�� ' A6 # 6"��� W  ' , is the probability that �H� will
and �  will succeed times the length of that dialog.
The third term, # � � AH� '9# � � A6 '9# 6"��� 6 ' , is the
probability that both �H� and �6 fail times the associated length. We can multiply out and rearrange

Thus, if the above inequality holds, then "$#&% � 'ED
"$#&%  ' , and the leader should ask questions from
��� first. Otherwise, "$#&%  ' � ")#&% � ' , and the leader
should ask questions from �2 first.
We conjecture that in the general case of G mutually independent rule sets, the proper ordering of
rule sets is obtained by calculating W �F� 62� #
�
� H � � '
for each rule set �6� , and sorting the rule sets by
those values. Preliminary experimental evidence
supports this conjecture, but no formal proof has
been derived yet.
Note that calculating A and 6 for each rule set
takes polynomial time, as does sorting the rule sets
into their proper order and sorting the questions
within each rule set. Thus the solution can be obtained in polynomial time.
As an example, consider the rule sets � � �
� ��� �2# and �6 � � �%�� �6# . Suppose that we
assign e �� � GEIH  e � � GEQPB e %� � GEQRB and
e  �SGEQT . In this case, W �VU and A �SGEQUWH are
the same for both rule sets. However, 6 � � � QU �
and 6� � � XGYT , so evaluating W �`� 62� #
�
� H � � ' for
both rule sets, we discover that asking questions
from �  first results in the minimum expected dialog length.
5 Case: Two rule sets, one common
question
We now examine the simplest case in which the
rule sets are not mutually independent: the leader
has two rule sets �Q� and � , and ����Y� � � ba%# .
In this section, we will use "$#&%)c H ' to denote the
minimum expected length of the dialog (computed
using Theorem 1) resulting from the leader using
only ��� to accomplish the dialog task. The notation
"$#&% c6dH ' will denote the minimum expected length
of the dialog resulting from the leader using only
the rule set �� � � ba%# to accomplish the dialog task.
For example, a rule set �H�)� � � �2 ba%# with e �)�
GEQRB e  �eGEQf and e a �gGEQh , has "$#&%c ! ' � � IH5f and
"$#&% c6d! ' � � QR .
Theorem 3. Given rule sets �"� � � ba$ �  #
and �6 , such that �Q� � �0� � ia%# , if the leader asks
questions from �H� until �Q� either succeeds or fails
before asking any questions unique to � , then the
ordering of questions of � � that results in the minimum expected dialog length is given by ordering
the questions  �� by increasing p � , where

The proof is in two parts. First we show that
the questions unique to �"� should be ordered by

increasing probability of success given that the position of  ia is fixed. Then we show that given
the correct ordering of unique questions of �B� ,
 ba should appear in that ordering at the position
where
h t � h t v�pxw 7
d& r c v�pxw 7 & r
�b� h t v�pxw 7
d& r c v pxw 7 & r falls in the corresponding sequence of questions probabilities of success.
Space considerations preclude a complete listing
of the proof, but an outline follows.
Figure 1 shows an expression for the expected
dialog length for a dialog in which the leader
asks questions from �H� until �Q� either succeeds
or fails before asking any questions unique to �  .
The expression assumes an arbitrary ordering UT�
 ��  q  ba$  q � ���  . Note that if a question
occurring before  ia fails, the rest of the dialog has
a minimum expected length ")#&%)c & ' . If  ia fails, the
dialog terminates. If a question occurring after   a
fails, the rest of the dialog has minimum expected
length ")#&% c6d& ' .
If we fix the position of   a , we can show that the
questions unique to �H� must be ordered by increasing probability of success in the optimal ordering.
The proof proceeds by showing that switching the
positions of any two unique questions   q and  �
in
an arbitrary ordering of the questions of � � , where
  q occurs before  �
in the original ordering, the
expected length for the new ordering is less than
the expected length for the original ordering if and
only if e �
D e q .
After showing that the unique questions of �B�
must be ordered by increasing probability of success in the optimal ordering, we must then show
how to find the position of   a in the optimal ordering. We say that   a occurs at position @ in ordering U if  ia immediately follows   q in the ordering. ")#&% q ' is the expected length for the ordering with  ia at position @ . We can show that if
"$#&% q ' D2")#&% q � � ' then
h t c v pxw 7 & r � h t v�pxw 7
d& r
�dc v�pyw 7 & r � h t v�pxw 7
d& r D e q � �
by a process similar to that used in the proof of
Theorem 2. Since the unique questions in �B� are
ordered by increasing probability of success, finding the optimal position of the common question
  in the ordering of the questions of � � corresponds to the problem of finding where the value
of
h c v pxw 7 & r � hbv�pyw 7
d& r
�dc v�pyw 7 & r � hbv�pyw 7
d& r falls in the sorted list of probabilities of success of the unique questions of � � . If
the value immediately precedes the value of e � in
the list, then the common question should immediately precede  �� in the optimal ordering of questions of �Q� .
Theorem 3 provides a method for obtaining the
optimal ordering of questions in �"� , given that �Q�
is selected first by the leader. The leader can use
the same method to determine the optimal ordering of the questions of �2 if � is selected first. The
two optimal orderings give rise to two different expected dialog lengths; the leader should select the
rule set and ordering that leads to the minimal expected dialog length. The calculation can be done
in polynomial time.
6 Approximate solutions in the general
case
Specific instances of the optimization problem can
be solved in polynomial time, but the general case
has worst-case complexity that is exponential in
the number of questions. To approximate the optimal solution, we can use some of the insights
gained from the analysis of the special cases to
generate methods for selecting a rule set, and selecting a question from the chosen rule set. Theorem 1 says that if there is only one rule set available, then the least probable question should be
asked first. We can also observe that if the dialog
succeeds, then in general, we would like to minimize the number of rule sets that must be tried
before succeeding. Combining these two observations produces a policy of selecting the question
with the minimal probability of success from the
rule set with the maximal probability of success.

Table 1: Average expected dialog length (measured in number of leader questions) for the optimal case and several simple approximation methods over 1000 dialog scenarios. Each
scenario consisted of 6 rule sets of 2 to 5 questions each, created from a pool of 9 different questions.
We tested this policy by generating 1000 dialog
scenarios. First, a pool of nine questions with randomly assigned probabilities of success was generated. Six rule sets were created using these nine
questions, each containing between two and five
questions. The number of questions in each rule
set was selected randomly, with each value being
equally probable. We then calculated the expected
length of the dialog that would result if the leader
were to select questions according to the following
five schemes:
1. Optimal
2. Most probable rule set, least probable question
3. Random rule set, least probable question
4. Most probable rule set, random question
5. Random rule set, random question.
The results are summarized in Table 1.
7 Further Research
We intend to discover other special cases for
which polynomial time solutions exist, and investigate other methods for approximating the optimal solution. With a larger library of studied special cases, even if polynomial time solutions do
not exist for such cases, heuristics designed for use
in special cases may provide better performance.
Another extension to this research is to extend
the information model maintained by the leader to
allow the probabilities returned by the model to be
non-independent.
8 Conclusions
Optimizing the behavior of dialog participants can
be a complex task even in restricted and specialized environments. For the case of non-mixed initiative dialogs, selecting dialog actions that minimize the overall expected dialog length is a nontrivial problem, but one which has some solutions
in certain instances. A study of the characteristics
of the problem can yield insights that lead to the
development of methods that allow a dialog participant to perform in a principled way in the face
of intractable complexity.
