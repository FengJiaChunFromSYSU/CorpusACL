Abstract
We present a discriminative structureprediction model for the letter-to-phoneme
task, a crucial step in text-to-speech processing. Our method encompasses three tasks
that have been previously handled separately:
input segmentation, phoneme prediction,
and sequence modeling. The key idea is
online discriminative training, which updates
parameters according to a comparison of the
current system output to the desired output,
allowing us to train all of our components
together. By folding the three steps of a
pipeline approach into a unified dynamic
programming framework, we are able to
achieve substantial performance gains. Our
results surpass the current state-of-the-art on
six publicly available data sets representing
four different languages.
1 Introduction
Letter-to-phoneme (L2P) conversion is the task
of predicting the pronunciation of a word, represented as a sequence of phonemes, from its orthographic form, represented as a sequence of letters. The L2P task plays a crucial role in speech
synthesis systems (Schroeter et al., 2002), and is
an important part of other applications, including
spelling correction (Toutanova and Moore, 2001)
and speech-to-speech machine translation (Engelbrecht and Schultz, 2005).
Converting a word into its phoneme representation is not a trivial task. Dictionary-based approaches cannot achieve this goal reliably, due to
unseen words and proper names. Furthermore, the
construction of even a modestly-sized pronunciation
dictionary requires substantial human effort for each
new language. Effective rule-based approaches can
be designed for some languages such as Spanish.
However, Kominek and Black (2006) show that in
languages with a less transparent relationship between spelling and pronunciation, such as English,
Dutch, or German, the number of letter-to-sound
rules grows almost linearly with the lexicon size.
Therefore, most recent work in this area has focused
on machine-learning approaches.
In this paper, we present a joint framework for
letter-to-phoneme conversion, powered by online
discriminative training. By updating our model parameters online, considering only the current system
output and its feature representation, we are able to
not only incorporate overlapping features, but also to
use the same learning framework with increasingly
complex search techniques. We investigate two online updates: averaged perceptron and Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA). We evaluate our
system on L2P data sets covering English, French,
Dutch and German. In all cases, our system outperforms the current state of the art, reducing the best
observed error rate by as much as 46%.
2 Previous work
Letter-to-phoneme conversion is a complex task, for
which a number of diverse solutions have been proposed. It is a structure prediction task; both the input
and output are structured, consisting of sequences of
letters and phonemes, respectively. This makes L2P
a poor fit for many machine-learning techniques that
are formulated for binary classification.
905
The L2P task is also characterized by the existence of a hidden structure connecting input to output. The training data consists of letter strings paired
with phoneme strings, without explicit links connecting individual letters to phonemes. The subtask
of inserting these links, called letter-to-phoneme
alignment, is not always straightforward. For example, consider the word "phoenix" and its corresponding phoneme sequence [f i n I k s], where
we encounter cases of two letters generating a single phoneme (phf), and a single letter generating two phonemes (xk s). Fortunately, alignments between letters and phonemes can be discovered reliably with unsupervised generative models.
Originally, L2P systems assumed one-to-one alignment (Black et al., 1998; Damper et al., 2005), but
recently many-to-many alignment has been shown
to perform better (Bisani and Ney, 2002; Jiampojamarn et al., 2007). Given such an alignment, L2P
can be viewed either as a sequence of classification
problems, or as a sequence modeling problem.
In the classification approach, each phoneme is
predicted independently using a multi-class classifier such as decision trees (Daelemans and Bosch,
1997; Black et al., 1998) or instance-based learning (Bosch and Daelemans, 1998). These systems
predict a phoneme for each input letter, using the
letter and its context as features. They leverage the
structure of the input but ignore any structure in the
output.
L2P can also be viewed as a sequence modeling, or tagging problem. These approaches model
the structure of the output, allowing previously predicted phonemes to inform future decisions. The
supervised Hidden Markov Model (HMM) applied
by Taylor (2005) achieved poor results, mostly because its maximum-likelihood emission probabilities cannot be informed by the emitted letter's context. Other approaches, such as those of Bisani and
Ney (2002) and Marchand and Damper (2000), have
shown that better performance can be achieved by
pairing letter substrings with phoneme substrings,
allowing context to be captured implicitly by these
groupings.
Recently, two hybrid methods have attempted
to capture the flexible context handling of
classification-based methods, while also modeling the sequential nature of the output. The
constraint satisfaction inference (CSInf) approach (Bosch and Canisius, 2006) improves the
performance of instance-based classification (Bosch
and Daelemans, 1998) by predicting for each letter
a trigram of phonemes consisting of the previous,
current and next phonemes in the sequence. The
final output sequence is the sequence of predicted
phonemes that satisfies the most unigram, bigram
and trigram agreement constraints. The second
hybrid approach (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007) also
extends instance-based classification. It employs a
many-to-many letter-to-phoneme alignment model,
allowing substrings of letters to be classified into
substrings of phonemes, and introducing an input
segmentation step before prediction begins. The
method accounts for sequence information with
post-processing: the numerical scores of possible
outputs from an instance-based phoneme predictor
are combined with phoneme transition probabilities in order to identify the most likely phoneme
sequence.
3 A joint approach
By observing the strengths and weaknesses of previous approaches, we can create the following prioritized desiderata for any L2P system:
1. The phoneme predicted for a letter should be
informed by the letter's context in the input
word.
2. In addition to single letters, letter substrings
should also be able to generate phonemes.
3. Phoneme sequence information should be included in the model.
Each of the previous approaches focuses on one
or more of these items. Classification-based approaches such as the decision tree system (Black
et al., 1998) and instance-based learning system (Bosch and Daelemans, 1998) take into account the letter's context (#1). By pairing letter substrings with phoneme substrings, the joint n-gram
approach (Bisani and Ney, 2002) accounts for all
three desiderata, but each operation is informed only
by a limited amount of left context. The manyto-many classifier of Jiampojamarn et al. (2007)
also attempts to account for all three, but it adheres

strictly to the pipeline approach illustrated in Figure 1a. It applies in succession three separately
trained modules for input segmentation, phoneme
prediction, and sequence modeling. Similarly, the
CSInf approach modifies independent phoneme predictions (#1) in order to assemble them into a cohesive sequence (#3) in post-processing.
The pipeline approaches are undesirable for two
reasons. First, when decisions are made in sequence,
errors made early in the sequence can propagate forward and throw off later processing. Second, each
module is trained independently, and the training
methods are not aware of the tasks performed later
in the pipeline. For example, optimal parameters for
a phoneme prediction module may vary depending
on whether or not the module will be used in conjunction with a phoneme sequence model.
We propose a joint approach to L2P conversion,
grounded in dynamic programming and online discriminative training. We view L2P as a tagging task
that can be performed with a discriminative learning method, such as the Perceptron HMM (Collins,
2002). The Perceptron HMM naturally handles
phoneme prediction (#1) and sequence modeling
(#3) simultaneously, as shown in Figure 1b. Furthermore, unlike a generative HMM, it can incorporate many overlapping source n-gram features to
represent context. In order to complete the conversion from a pipeline approach to a joint approach,
we fold our input segmentation step into the exact search framework by replacing a separate segmentation module (#2) with a monotone phrasal decoder (Zens and Ney, 2004). At this point all three of
our desiderata are incorporated into a single module,

Our joint approach to L2P lends itself to several
refinements. We address an underfitting problem of
the perceptron by replacing it with a more robust
Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA), which
adds an explicit notion of margin and takes into account the system's current n-best outputs. In addition, with all of our features collected under a unified
framework, we are free to conjoin context features
with sequence features to create a powerful linearchain model (Sutton and McCallum, 2006).
4 Online discriminative training
In this section, we describe our entire L2P system.
An outline of our discriminative training process is
presented in Algorithm 1. An online process repeatedly finds the best output(s) given the current
weights, and then updates those weights to make the
model favor the correct answer over the incorrect
ones.
The system consists of the following three main
components, which we describe in detail in Sections
4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.
1. A scoring model, represented by a weighted
linear combination of features ( � (x, y)).
2. A search for the highest scoring phoneme sequence for a given input word (Step 4).
3. An online update equation to move the model
away from incorrect outputs and toward the
correct output (Step 5).
4.1 Model
Given an input word x and an output phoneme sequence y, we define (x, y) to be a feature vector
907
representing the evidence for the sequence y found
in x, and  to be a feature weight vector providing a weight for each component of (x, y). We
assume that both the input and output consist of m
substrings, such that xi generates yi, 0  i < m.
At training time, these substrings are taken from a
many-to-many letter-to-phoneme alignment. At test
time, input segmentation is handled by either a segmentation module or a phrasal decoder.
Table 1 shows our feature template that we include in (x, y). We use only indicator features;
each feature takes on a binary value indicating
whether or not it is present in the current (x, y)
pair. The context features express letter evidence
found in the input string x, centered around the
generator xi of each yi. The parameter c establishes the size of the context window. Note that
we consider not only letter unigrams but all n-grams
that fit within the window, which enables the model
to assign phoneme preferences to contexts containing specific sequences, such as ing and tion. The
transition features are HMM-like sequence features,
which enforce cohesion on the output side. We include only first-order transition features, which look
back to the previous phoneme substring generated
by the system, because our early development experiments indicated that larger histories had little impact on performance; however, the number of previous substrings that are taken into account could be
extended at a polynomial cost. Finally, the linearchain features (Sutton and McCallum, 2006) associate the phoneme transitions between yi-1 and yi
with each n-gram surrounding xi. This combination of sequence and context data provides the model
with an additional degree of control.
4.2 Search
Given the current feature weight vector , we are interested in finding the highest-scoring phoneme sequence ^
y in the set Y of all possible phoneme sequences. In the pipeline approach (Figure 1b), the
input word is segmented into letter substrings by an
instance-based classifier (Aha et al., 1991), which
learns a letter segmentation model from many-tomany alignments (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007). The
search for the best output sequence is then effectively a substring tagging problem, and we can compute the arg max operation in line 4 of Algorithm 1

with the standard HMM Viterbi search algorithm.
In the joint approach (Figure 1c), we perform segmentation and L2P prediction simultaneously by applying the monotone search algorithm developed for
statistical machine translation (Zens and Ney, 2004).
Thanks to its ability to translate phrases (in our case,
letter substrings), we can accomplish the arg max
operation without specifying an input segmentation
in advance; the search enumerates all possible segmentations. Furthermore, the language model functionality of the decoder allows us to keep benefiting
from the transition and linear-chain features, which
are explicit in the previous HMM approach.
The search can be efficiently performed by the
dynamic programming recurrence shown below.
We define Q(j, p) as the maximum score of the
phoneme sequence ending with the phoneme p generated by the letter sequence x1 . . . xj. Since we
are no longer provided an input segmentation in advance, in this framework we view x as a sequence of
J letters, as opposed to substrings. The phoneme p
is the phoneme produced in the previous step. The
expression (xj
j +1, p , p) is a convenient way to express the subvector of our complete feature vector
(x, y) that describes the substring pair (xi, yi
i-1),
where xi = xj
j +1, yi-1 = p and yi = p. The
value N limits the size of the dynamically created
908
substrings. We use N = 2, which reflects a similar limit in our many-to-many aligner. The special
symbol $ represents a starting phoneme or ending
phoneme. The value in Q(I + 1, $) is the score of
highest scoring phoneme sequence corresponding to
the input word. The actual sequence can be retrieved
by backtracking through the table Q.
Q(0, $) = 0
Q(j, p) = max

j +1, p , p) + Q(j , p )}
Q(J + 1, $) = max

4.3 Online update
We investigate two model updates to drive our online
discriminative learning. The simple perceptron update requires only the system's current output, while
MIRA allows us to take advantage of the system's
current n-best outputs.
Perceptron
Learning a discriminative structure prediction
model with a perceptron update was first proposed
by Collins (2002). The perceptron update process
is relatively simple, involving only vector addition.
In line 5 of Algorithm 1, the weight vector  is updated according to the best output ^
y under the current weights and the true output y in the training
data. If ^
y = y, there is no update to the weights;
otherwise, the weights are updated as follows:
 =  + (x, y) - (x, ^
y) (1)
We iterate through the training data until the system
performance drops on a held-out set. In a separable
case, the perceptron will find an  such that:
^
y  Y - {y} :  � (x, y) >  � (x, ^
y) (2)
Since real-world data is not often separable, the average of all  values seen throughout training is used
in place of the final , as the average generalizes better to unseen data.
MIRA
In the perceptron training algorithm, no update is
derived from a particular training example so long
as the system is predicting the correct phoneme sequence. The perceptron has no notion of margin: a
slim preference for the correct sequence is just as
good as a clear preference. During development, we
observed that this lead to underfitting the training examples; useful and consistent evidence was ignored
because of the presence of stronger evidence in the
same example. The MIRA update provides a principled method to resolve this problem.
The Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm or
MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003) updates the
model based on the system's n-best output. It employs a margin update which can induce an update
even when the 1-best answer is correct. It does so by
finding a weight vector that separates incorrect sequences in the n-best list from the correct sequence
by a variable width margin.
The update process finds the smallest change in
the current weights so that the new weights will separate the correct answer from each incorrect answer
by a margin determined by a structured loss function. The loss function describes the distance between an incorrect prediction and the correct one;
that is, it quantifies just how wrong the proposed sequence is. This update process can be described as
an optimization problem:
minn n - o
subject to ^
y  Yn :
n � ((x, y) - (x, ^
y))  (y, ^
y)
(3)
where Yn is a set of n-best outputs found under the
current model, y is the correct answer, o is the current weight vector, n is the new weight vector, and
(y, ^
y) is the loss function.
Since our direct objective is to produce the correct phoneme sequence for a given word, the most
intuitive way to define the loss function (y, ^
y) is
binary: 0 if ^
y = y, and 1 otherwise. We refer to
this as 0-1 loss. Another possibility is to base the
loss function on the phoneme error rate, calculated
as the Levenshtein distance between y and ^
y. We
can also compute a combined loss function as an
equally-weighted linear combination of the 0-1 and
phoneme loss functions.
MIRA training is similar to averaged perceptron
training, but instead of finding the single best answer, we find the n-best answers (Yn) and update
weights according to Equation 3. To find the n-best
answers, we modify the HMM and monotone search
algorithms to keep track of the n-best phonemes at

optimization in Equation 3 is a standard quadratic
programming problem that can be solved by using Hildreth's algorithm (Censor and Zenios, 1997).
The details of our implementation of MIRA within
the SVMlight framework (Joachims, 1999) are given
in the Appendix A. Like the perceptron algorithm,
MIRA returns the average of all weight vectors produced during learning.
5 Evaluation
We evaluated our approach on English, German and
Dutch CELEX (Baayen et al., 1996), French Brulex,
English Nettalk and English CMUDict data sets.
Except for English CELEX, we used the data sets
from the PRONALSYL letter-to-phoneme conversion challenge1. Each data set is divided into 10
folds: we used the first one for testing, and the rest
for training. In all cases, we hold out 5% of our
training data to determine when to stop perceptron
or MIRA training. We ignored one-to-one alignments included in the PRONALSYL data sets, and
instead induced many-to-many alignments using the
method of Jiampojamarn et al. (2007).
Our English CELEX data set was extracted directly from the CELEX database. After removing
duplicate words, phrases, and abbreviations, the data
set contained 66,189 word-phoneme pairs, of which
10% was designated as the final test set, and the rest
as the training set. We performed our development
experiments on the latter part, and then used the final

test set to compare the performance of our system to
other results reported in the literature.
We report the system performance in terms of
word accuracy, which rewards only completely correct phoneme sequences. Word accuracy is more
demanding than phoneme accuracy, which considers the number of correct phonemes. We feel that
word accuracy is a more appropriate error metric,
given the quality of current L2P systems. Phoneme
accuracy is not sensitive enough to detect improvements in highly accurate L2P systems: Black et al.
(1998) report 90% phoneme accuracy is equivalent
to approximately 60% word accuracy, while 99%
phoneme accuracy corresponds to only 90% word
accuracy.
5.1 Development Experiments
We began development with a zero-order Perceptron
HMM with an external segmenter, which uses only
the context features from Table 1. The zero-order
Perceptron HMM is equivalent to training a multiclass perceptron to make independent substring-tophoneme predictions; however, this framework allows us to easily extend to structured models. We investigate the effect of augmenting this baseline system in turn with larger context sizes, the MIRA update, joint segmentation, and finally sequence features. We report the impact of each contribution on
our English CELEX development set.
Figure 2 shows the performance of our baseline
L2P system with different context size values (c).
Increasing the context size has a dramatic effect on
accuracy, but the effect begins to level off for context sizes greater than 5. Henceforth, we report the

results with context size c = 5.
Figure 3 illustrates the effect of varying the size of
n-best list in the MIRA update. n = 1 is equivalent
to taking into account only the best answer, which
does not address the underfitting problem. A large
n-best list makes it difficult for the optimizer to separate the correct and incorrect answers, resulting in
large updates at each step. We settle on n = 10 for
the subsequent experiments.
The choice of MIRA's loss function has a minimal impact on performance, probably because our
baseline system already has a very high phoneme accuracy. We employ the loss function that combines
0-1 and phoneme error rate, due to its marginal improvement over 0-1 loss on the development set.
Looking across columns in Table 2, we observe
over 8% reduction in word error rate when the perceptron update is replaced with the MIRA update.
Since the perceptron is a considerably simpler algorithm, we continue to report the results of both variants throughout this section.
Table 2 also shows the word accuracy of our system after adding the option to conduct joint segmentation through phrasal decoding. The 15% relative
reduction in error rate in the second row demonstrates the utility of folding the segmentation step
into the search. It also shows that the joint framework enables the system to reduce and compensate
for errors that occur in a pipeline. This is particularly interesting because our separate instance-based
segmenter is highly accurate, achieving 98% segmentation accuracy. Our experiments indicate that
the application of joint segmentation recovers more
than 60% of the available improvements, according
to an upper bound determined by utilizing perfect
segmentation.2
Table 3 illustrates the effect of our sequence features on both the perceptron and MIRA systems.

Replacing the zero-order HMM with the first-order
HMM makes little difference by itself, but combined with the more powerful linear-chain features,
it results in a relative error reduction of about 12%.
In general, the linear-chain features make a much
larger difference than the relatively simple transition
features, which underscores the importance of using source-side context when assessing sequences of
phonemes.
The results reported in Tables 2 and 3 were calculated using cross validation on the training part of
the CELEX data set. With the exception of adding
the 1st order HMM, the differences between versions are statistically significant according to McNemar's test at 95% confidence level. On one CPU of
AMD Opteron 2.2GHz with 6GB of installed memory, it takes approximately 32 hours to train the
MIRA model with all features, compared to 12 hours
for the zero-order model.
5.2 System Comparison
Table 4 shows the comparison between our approach
and other systems on the evaluation data sets. We
trained our system using n-gram context, transition,
and linear-chain features. All parameters, including the size of n-best list, size of letter context, and
the choice of loss functions, were established on
the English CELEX development set, as presented
in our previous experiments. With the exception of
the system described in (Jiampojamarn et al., 2007),
which we re-ran on our current test sets, the results
of other systems are taken from the original papers.
Although these comparisons are necessarily indirect
due to different experimental settings, they strongly
suggest that our system outperforms all previous
published results on all data sets, in some case by
large margins. When compared to the current stateof-the-art performance of each data set, the relative
reductions in error rate range from 7% to 46%.

6 Conclusion
We have presented a joint framework for letter-tophoneme conversion, powered by online discriminative training. We introduced two methods to convert multi-letter substrings into phonemes: one relying on a separate segmenter, and the other incorporating a unified search that finds the best input segmentation while generating the output sequence. We
investigated two online update algorithms: the perceptron, which is straightforward to implement, and
MIRA, which boosts performance by avoiding underfitting. Our systems employ source n-gram features and linear-chain features, which substantially
increase L2P accuracy. Our experimental results
demonstrate the power of a joint approach based on
online discriminative training with large feature sets.
In all cases, our MIRA-based system advances the
current state of the art by reducing the best reported
error rate.

In order to approximate a hard margin using the
soft-margin optimizer of SVMlight, we assign a very
large penalty value to C, thus making the use of any
slack variables (i) prohibitively expensive. We define the vector w as the difference between the new
and previous weights: w = n - o. We constrain
w to mirror the constraints in Equation 3. Since each
^
y in the n-best list (Yn) needs a constraint based on
its feature difference vector, we define a ti for each:
^
y  Yn : ti = (x, y) - (x, ^
y)
Substituting that equation along with the inferred
equation an = ao + w into our original MIRA constraints yields:
(o + w) � ti  (y, ^
y)
Moving o to the right-hand-side to isolate w � ti on
the left, we get a set of mappings that implement
MIRA in SVMlight's optimizer:
w n - o
ti (x, y) - (x, ^
y)
rhsi (y, ^
y) - o � ti
The output of the SVMlight optimizer is an update
vector w to be added to the current o.
